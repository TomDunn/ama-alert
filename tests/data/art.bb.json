The mediums/materials vary quite a bit, to the point that she'll have to tell me what each piece is made of individually if it's pertinent, and they're all textured/3D. I realize that the pictures aren't of the highest quality, but any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Just looking for a little advice.\n\nI have been an artsy/crafty person my whole life, mainly working with jewelry. I have done a small amount of painting mostly with watercolors. Lately, I've really been wanting to dive into acrylics, however I've noticed that I have a very literal eye when I'm working with 2D.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on painting more in the abstract?","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1e9aor","clicked":false,"title":"Tips for gaining a more abstract mindset while painting?","media":null,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2qirl","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/painting/comments/1e9aor/tips_for_gaining_a_more_abstract_mindset_while/","name":"t3_1e9aor","created":1368497317,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/painting/comments/1e9aor/tips_for_gaining_a_more_abstract_mindset_while/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"missyukidear","created_utc":1368468517,"ups":1,"num_comments":5,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"imgur.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"painting","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1e7vm5","clicked":false,"title":"My mother's day gift to my mom!
