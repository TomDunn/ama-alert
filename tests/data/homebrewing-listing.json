I know the BCC is network connected, but would love if anyone knew of a way to pass thermistor values along wirelessly, and also to trigger relays wirelessly to the BCC? Ideally, I'd have one doodad with a thermistor, and another doodad that is a current interrupter, talking to the BBC over the network or analog wireless. Take these two things anywhere and temperature control is happening.\n\nWeird specific question, but hard to believe I'm the only one...\n\nThanks for your help!\n", "likes": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1ejy8u", "clicked": false, "title": "Remote temperature control for BCC?", "media": null, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "intermediate", "downs": 1, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1ejy8u/remote_temperature_control_for_bcc/", "name": "t3_1ejy8u", "created": 1368869103.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1ejy8u/remote_temperature_control_for_bcc/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "johnsonic", "created_utc": 1368840303.0, "ups": 1, "num_comments": 1, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "imgur.com", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1ei6l2", "clicked": false, "title": "Ad bad brew day is better than any work day", "media": null, "score": 28, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "http://f.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7bISpopoqT8GIJGA.jpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 6, "saved": false, "is_self": false, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1ei6l2/ad_bad_brew_day_is_better_than_any_work_day/", "name": "t3_1ei6l2", "created": 1368802240.0, "url": "http://imgur.com/a/qg7kD", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "Sgt_A", "created_utc": 1368773440.0, "ups": 34, "num_comments": 17, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "imgur.com", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1egkez", "clicked": false, "title": "Homemade Homebrew Bottle Storage System", "media": null, "score": 370, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "http://f.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tNunkNE0I8Pfn7c5.jpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 66, "saved": false, "is_self": false, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1egkez/homemade_homebrew_bottle_storage_system/", "name": "t3_1egkez", "created": 1368752016.0, "url": "http://imgur.com/a/AuOYN", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "llcooljessie", "created_utc": 1368723216.0, "ups": 436, "num_comments": 54, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "imgur.com", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1ehmrr", "clicked": false, "title": "I thought it was going to be a slow night.

I did a search for an answer and only found the reverse of my question.\n\nI have 10 gallons of wine - 5 of Baco Noir and 5 of Edelweiss that are just about ready to be bottled.  I have a friend with a corker I could borrow, but the thing is, I don't have nearly as many wine bottles as I do beer bottles.\n\nWould it break some mandate in the brewing universe to bottle wine in beer bottles with beer caps?  Or should I really bite the bullet, buy a bunch of clean bottles from the homebrew shop and borrow my friend's corker?\n\nIf it's okay, should I consider waxing most of the caps to deal with oxidation?\n\nThanks!!", "likes": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1eil8i", "clicked": false, "title": "Can I bottle wine in beer bottles?", "media": null, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 1, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1eil8i/can_i_bottle_wine_in_beer_bottles/", "name": "t3_1eil8i", "created": 1368826358.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1eil8i/can_i_bottle_wine_in_beer_bottles/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "BagelTrollop", "created_utc": 1368797558.0, "ups": 3, "num_comments": 14, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Homebrewing", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I tried my hand at a milestone black pearl kit.
