Glass would most likely produce a much better result since I used very cheaply made glasses from China.\nIt makes you wonder if POV blogs/videos will soon be a common thing.","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f1j1k","clicked":false,"title":"Experimental Point-of-view concept [x-post from /r/googleglass]","media":null,"score":4,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2qwgz","edited":1369607690,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":2,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/videography/comments/1f1j1k/experimental_pointofview_concept_xpost_from/","name":"t3_1f1j1k","created":1369537552,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/1f1j1k/experimental_pointofview_concept_xpost_from/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"taylertech","created_utc":1369508752,"ups":6,"num_comments":1,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.videography","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"videography","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Reddit filmmaker folks, here&amp;#39;s the trailer to my new comedy film &amp;quot;Adventures of the Haunted Hunted&amp;quot;.

He always manages to convince Emanuele to help him, who almost shits himself executing those increasingly dangerous crimes. But Danieles plan doesn’t work out, because he has success. The press starts reporting the crimes and soon, the cousins are the talk of the city and at home, everyone is very proud of Daniele.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One night, comitting another one of their audacious crimes, they try to steal a very expensive diamond necklace, which belongs to the foreign secretary of Italy. Whilst opening the bed stand drawer in her (assumingly) empty bedroom, someone wakes up: It’s the President of Italy, who has been awaiting his foreign secretary in bed for their nightly get-togethers. Both parties are fairly surprised, Emanuele drops unconscious right away, but Daniele and the President engage in a conversation: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It soon becomes clear that the President is no saint himself. He promises to ignore what he has seen, if the two criminals help him clean out his closet full of mafia connections and election fraud. Daniele and Emanuele are to steal a suitcase filled with evidence against the President from the state prosecutor and bring it to the President. \nSurprised by how shady the President is, Daniele forges a plan to kill two birds with one stone: Exposing the President publicly and becoming a hero for doing so, and being able to leave his criminal life behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Dear reddit, I’ve been a lurker for on /r/Screenwriting for a long time but today I had an idea which I thought would be worth sharing with you and I’d like to have your opinion on it.

Nostalgic, he goes back to what he considers his &amp;#39;masterpiece&amp;#39;: a mansion in a rich neighborhood which he helped design. Across the street, a new building is under construction. He finds himself talking to one of the workers on the construction site about the house, and the worker says a new man had moved in and hoards his wealth in there. Realizing that he still has the blueprints, and that the worker knows everything about the house, the architect hatches a scheme for them to rob the house together and flee the state. They pick Halloween night to rob the house, when the owner of the house was supposed to be out at a party (the house has a large gate, no trick-or-treaters would not be an issue). Making sure to leave before the owner gets back, they sneak into the house through the upper window. They walk downstairs into the living room where the lights suddenly turn on, people jump out from behind the couches, and it is revealed that the two have walked into a surprise party meant for the owner. Mistaking the two for people dressing up as robbers, they tell them to get down as well, and turn the lights off again in anticipation of the guest. The burglars try to talk themselves out of the party, stating they had the wrong address, when the guest walks in– none other than the architect&amp;#39;s ex-girlfriend, whom he had gone to college with. Her new husband (a millionaire entrepreneur) had driven her around town with the pretense of going to a party, but was really planning a surprise Halloween party for her. Confused, the party tries to find out who had invited him. After the architect says he brought the worker (who he says is a colleague from his university) because he was his boyfriend (falsely stating that he had come out of the closet), the two are worried that the husband is suspicious of them, and try to leave as quickly as possible– however, something or someone always ends up getting in their way. They find themselves in conversations– the architect is reconnecting with his ex-girlfriend, while the worker stumbles his way through intellectual discussion while downing glasses of wine (far better than what he could afford). Having seen the architect&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;boyfriend&amp;#39; on the construction site across the street, the husband uses the worker&amp;#39;s intoxicated state to wry the truth out of him. However, this plan is to no avail, so the husband goes upstairs in hope of finding clues. Meanwhile, the architect realizes that he is still madly in love with his ex-girlfriend, and tries to carefully reveal his affection for her and tell her the truth. However, he is interrupted when dinner is announced. When the guests are about to eat, the husband rushes downstairs to make a &amp;#39;toast&amp;#39;– which turns into a prosecution against the architect and the worker, complete with evidence that the two were actually burglars, which the two try their best to refute. Convinced, the party guests are about to call the cops when the husband breaks down, crying, and out of nowhere kisses the worker passionately. He reveals that he had been secretly gay for years, had a deep crush on the worker since he saw him across the street, and had fabricated the evidence in order to imprison the worker so that he would never see him again and suppress his love, causing the worker to state that he is not gay. The guests and the wife, having been shocked twice, are speechless. The architect reveals that he and the worker were not a couple, and that he is in love with his ex-girlfriend. When the architect is asked why he invited the worker in the first place, the worker, drunk as hell, reveals that the two had, in fact, been trying to rob the place. The wife runs away to her bedroom. The two try to defend themselves while the guests either yell at them or awkwardly leave, with the husband sitting at the chair, contemplating what he had just done. Suddenly, the wife rushes downstairs, covered in jewelry, and tells the architect to carry whatever he can and drive off with her.

However, if the film makes money, everyone including the writer/s will get a cut. \n\nWe need this script within 72 hours so please, if you'd like to support a student film effort and you'd like to see your vision come to life on screen, just comment below and we can exchange details, even arrange a meeting to iron out the logistics of it all. \n\nThanks for reading and I hope someone is interested!","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1edh5w","clicked":false,"title":"Attention Sydney screenwriters!","media":null,"score":9,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2qupf","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":9,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/Screenwriting/comments/1edh5w/attention_sydney_screenwriters/","name":"t3_1edh5w","created":1368639616,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1edh5w/attention_sydney_screenwriters/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"pharaoh94","created_utc":1368610816,"ups":18,"num_comments":7,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"cinemablend.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Screenwriting","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1edhgv","clicked":false,"title":"Iron Man 3 Scribe Drew Pearce Writing Mission: Impossible 5.","media":null,"score":5,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ZLEALxrO5TqXF_l7.jpg","subreddit_id":"t5_2qupf","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":2,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/Screenwriting/comments/1edhgv/iron_man_3_scribe_drew_pearce_writing_mission/","name":"t3_1edhgv","created":1368640223,"url":"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Iron-Man-3-Scribe-Drew-Pearce-Writing-Mission-Impossible-5-37540.html","author_flair_text":null,"author":"NinjaDiscoJesus","created_utc":1368611423,"ups":7,"num_comments":2,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"moviefail.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"flicks","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1epeuk","clicked":false,"title":"Much Ado About Nothing is less Whedon, more Shakespeare - and that's not such a bad thing.
