SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things I would like to focus on and get squared away are the local rules for this subreddit. Currently, the only rules we follow are listed in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicOfReddit/comments/ncq8w/simplified_charter_republiquette/\"&gt;Republiquette&lt;/a&gt; but I do think a few more rules for submissions can ensure that this subreddit adheres to higher standards with a front page that adds more value to the community. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am hoping that all of us who subscribe to here can act as &amp;quot;early adapters&amp;quot; and really flesh out any regulations that we need to prevent the kinds of things that make posts in other science related subreddits less than ideal. Things like bias, sensationalism, poor journalism, etc. are some of the key areas to address. After looking at your comments and suggestions I would like to offer a few ideas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, &lt;a href=\"/r/RepublicofPolitics\"&gt;/r/RepublicofPolitics&lt;/a&gt; has 3 great local rules that I think would apply to this subreddit. They address the issue of proper sourcing, editorialized headlines, and everything else that falls under the Republiquette.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Submissions will be removed by the moderators if:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... the title attributes to some person a claim (either by direct quotation or paraphrase), unless the link is to the full, original source of that claim (proper source rule);&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... the title features descriptive terms, or issues claims, not made in the content of the linked-to article or media (editorial title rule);&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...the submission violates any section of the Republiquette (link to the right)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rule number one as I read it will help to reduce sensational headlines, or at the very least require that the source of a claim is made apparent. Most of the time that will mean that if your post is about new research or findings that you will need to link directly to the original document about that information. This is where it&amp;#39;s gets tricky. Medical journals, research, and case studies are often times hidden behind a pay wall, but sometimes the abstract remains free. What I propose is that we accept abstracts as the original source if the full documents for that source are behind the pay wall. Then, if someone wanted to submit a report on those findings from a news outlet they could do so in the comments. &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/republicofscience/comments/pomej/doctors_at_a_us_based_heart_institute_repair/\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rule number two will help to reduce submissions that are biased and titles that are overly editorialized. Hopefully along with the proper source rule the subreddit will not fall prey to some of the more common Reddit submission offenses. Along those lines, I would also like to propose a rule prohibiting photos within this subreddit. I think RoScience should be for science news, information, and discussion. There are a ton of other places where people can post pics, and I really think those subreddits are a more appropriate venue than the Republic of Science. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the very least these rules will help to curb some of the main issues people have with other science subreddits. I don&amp;#39;t know if they are perfect, but it is certainly a good step in the right directions. If there is anything else you want to bring to the table feel free to comment below. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only other point I wanted to touch on is one concerning comments. One of the major problems people have with science subreddits is that the comments usually devolve into humor and banter, or something much worse. Currently, the are Republic of a Reddit has no policy about the comments section and approved submitters and unapproved users alike can comment on any posts. I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind having a discussion about looking at moderating comments, but that might need to be a bridge we cross when we come to it. There is no disincentive for unapproved submitters to prevent them from making unwanted comments. Plus, it would be difficult to draft a hard and fast, completely objective rule of what warrants a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; comment. We would most likely have to have serval rules on the matter and that might make things more confusing than they should. So I am open to ideas, but I think the best thing to do right now is practice active voting on comments just like you practice on submissions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what do you think about these ideas? Is there anything else you would like to address in the rules? I would really appreciate anything thoughts or opinions you might have on these issues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"One of the things I would like to focus on and get squared away are the local rules for this subreddit.

Bruce Gernon and two passengers were flying from an island about 100 miles east of Florida on a journey which should have taken at least half an hour. Shortly after taking off Bruce was surrounded by an electric storm. He described a small opening in the clouds  which he could escape through. However this is when the &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; starts. The opening appeared to be a tunnel just wide enough for his plane but as he entered it his compass` and modern navigation equipment began failing which, if you read the article about Flight 19, links with the lack of navigational ability, explaining why they zig-zagged over the Bermuda triangle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As well as the failure in navigational tools Gernon also described a feeling of weightlessness, only lasting about 10 seconds, accompanied  by spiraling black lines in the clod tunnel. After traveling through the tunnel which &amp;quot;appeared to be 10 miles long&amp;quot; he escaped the clouds only to be enveloped in &amp;quot;greyish-yellow fog&amp;quot; which stuck to the plane. He describes this as Electronic Fog. After a few seconds of travelling with this fog he recievd a radio message from Florida Airport saying they had spotted him over Florida Beach, the destination of his voyage. Now the strange thing is this 100 mile journey only took him a couple of minutes, meaning he would have had to be travelling close to 2000 miles per hour where as his aircraft was only capable of a few 100mph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it clicked, what if the Philadelphia experiment was in fact true.

I'm concerned that my progress later could be hampered by this lack of first principles comprehension.\n\nI think the problem I'm having following the textbook could stem from the fact that at the beginning of the example problem they say:\n\n\"Let each time measurement in seconds be converted to meters by multiplying it by the \"conversion factor c,\" the speed of light.\"\n\nAnd at that point they basically just do it and continue on using the answers they arrived at from the multiplication.\n\nSo my question is why convert time measurements to meters and what is the significance of doing this?\n\nPlease let me know if you require further information relating the problem to answer.\n\nThanks in anticipation!\n\nPS: Please, if you feel that I'm looking in the wrong place for why I don't understand the invariance of the spacetime interval the *correct* way please point that out to me. I would still appreciate a few words on the the conversion of time to meters using c though.","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"v3hkl","clicked":false,"title":"Q.

As the earth spun faster and faster the net gravitational force along the equator, which is the downward non-spinning gravity force minus the upward centrifugal spinning force, soon approaches zero. Then about 65 million years ago, a large portion of that thick belt of land around the equator had less than zero gravity. Then the only thing holding it to the earth was the mechanical adhesion of the thick fluid lava layer called the asthenosphere. Then it simply overcame that sticky adhesion, something like unzipping a huge strip of Velcro around the equator, and it floated off into space. That three fourths of the thick rocky ring around the earth carried with it a large amount of the rapidly spinning earth&amp;#39;s energy in the form of angular momentum. It spiraled outward and was so large that it formed into a sphere by its own gravity and became what is today called the moon. A LITTLE MATH GOES A LONG WAY: Happy Birthday Moon To prove that, let&amp;#39;s do a little math. If the earth spins at 24 hours per day, as it does today, then the force of gravity at the equator is about the same as the force of gravity at the north and south poles. If the earth spins faster, in about a 12 hour revolution day, then the force of gravity at the equator is around half of what it would be at the poles. And if the earth spins around in about 7 hours, then the force of gravity becomes rather close to zero at the equator, while the force at the poles remains the same. There are several planets and moons in the solar system which rotate about that fast. It merely indicates how long the body in space has been cooling and shrinking. Rapid spinning is a normal part of planet and moon evolution, and is caused by the body shrinking with age and the principle of Conservation of Angular Momentum (CAM). With another quick calculation we can find the volume of the missing three quarters of the rocky continents of earth. Simply take three fourths of the surface area of the earth and multiply that by 37 miles, or the average depth to the hot molten fluid asthenosphere where the separation took place. That volume of the three fourths of the surface material missing from the earth&amp;#39;s rocky layer is exactly equal to the volume of the moon. And that calculation also shows the two volumes are exactly the same with an accuracy of about one percent.

Then about 65 million years ago, a large portion of that thick belt of land around the equator had less than zero gravity. Then the only thing holding it to the earth was the mechanical adhesion of the thick fluid lava layer called the asthenosphere. Then it simply overcame that sticky adhesion, something like unzipping a huge strip of Velcro around the equator, and it floated off into space. That three fourths of the thick rocky ring around the earth carried with it a large amount of the rapidly spinning earth's energy in the form of angular momentum. It spiraled outward and was so large that it formed into a sphere by its own gravity and became what is today called the moon. A LITTLE MATH GOES A LONG WAY: Happy Birthday Moon To prove that, let's do a little math. If the earth spins at 24 hours per day, as it does today, then the force of gravity at the equator is about the same as the force of gravity at the north and south poles. If the earth spins faster, in about a 12 hour revolution day, then the force of gravity at the equator is around half of what it would be at the poles. And if the earth spins around in about 7 hours, then the force of gravity becomes rather close to zero at the equator, while the force at the poles remains the same. There are several planets and moons in the solar system which rotate about that fast. It merely indicates how long the body in space has been cooling and shrinking. Rapid spinning is a normal part of planet and moon evolution, and is caused by the body shrinking with age and the principle of Conservation of Angular Momentum (CAM). With another quick calculation we can find the volume of the missing three quarters of the rocky continents of earth. Simply take three fourths of the surface area of the earth and multiply that by 37 miles, or the average depth to the hot molten fluid asthenosphere where the separation took place. That volume of the three fourths of the surface material missing from the earth's rocky layer is exactly equal to the volume of the moon. And that calculation also shows the two volumes are exactly the same with an accuracy of about one percent. Amazing. \"\n(many more facts addressed including animal fossil reocrds etc in full article.)\nPlease hammer away.","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"rffu9","clicked":false,"title":"Would love a critic of theory that moon spun off from earth's equator 65 million yrs ago","media":null,"score":2,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2tffi","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":2,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/astrophys/comments/rffu9/would_love_a_critic_of_theory_that_moon_spun_off/","name":"t3_rffu9","created":1332827788,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/astrophys/comments/rffu9/would_love_a_critic_of_theory_that_moon_spun_off/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"georedd","created_utc":1332824188,"ups":4,"num_comments":9,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"bbc.co.uk","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"astrophys","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"qyd56","clicked":false,"title":"BBC : Europe still keen on Mars missions","media":null,"score":6,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7P3pIsz55T_pyQCH.jpg","subreddit_id":"t5_2tffi","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":6,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/astrophys/comments/qyd56/bbc_europe_still_keen_on_mars_missions/","name":"t3_qyd56","created":1331849762,"url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17390576","author_flair_text":null,"author":"BritishEnglishPolice","created_utc":1331846162,"ups":12,"num_comments":0,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"bbc.co.uk","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"astrophys","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"qyd9m","clicked":false,"title":"BBC: Amateur photos of Jupiter and Venus","media":null,"score":6,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PyZMzUYjE_4ZJeYx.jpg","subreddit_id":"t5_2tffi","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":7,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/astrophys/comments/qyd9m/bbc_amateur_photos_of_jupiter_and_venus/","name":"t3_qyd9m","created":1331849878,"url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/17341807","author_flair_text":null,"author":"BritishEnglishPolice","created_utc":1331846278,"ups":13,"num_comments":0,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"bbc.co.uk","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"astrophys","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"qyd6o","clicked":false,"title":"Long space missions 'may damage eyesight'","media":null,"score":7,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/WFdVgBEo4r4RA9gs.jpg","subreddit_id":"t5_2tffi","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":5,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/astrophys/comments/qyd6o/long_space_missions_may_damage_eyesight/","name":"t3_qyd6o","created":1331849803,"url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17354304","author_flair_text":null,"author":"BritishEnglishPolice","created_utc":1331846203,"ups":12,"num_comments":0,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"bbc.co.uk","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"astrophys","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"qydah","clicked":false,"title":"Brecon Beacons National Park bids for dark sky status","media":null,"score":3,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"default","subreddit_id":"t5_2tffi","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":8,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/astrophys/comments/qydah/brecon_beacons_national_park_bids_for_dark_sky/","name":"t3_qydah","created":1331849903,"url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-17316599","author_flair_text":null,"author":"BritishEnglishPolice","created_utc":1331846303,"ups":11,"num_comments":1,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"vimeo.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{"content":"&lt;iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/38101676\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;","width":600,"scrolling":false,"height":338},"subreddit":"astrophys","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"qpk07","clicked":false,"title":"Dr Neil DeGrasse Tyson was asked \"What is the most astounding fact you can share with us about the Universe?\" -

But in sparse hot plasma, such as in the solar corona, the photons lose energy also in plasma redshift.  The energy loss per electron in the plasma redshift is about equal to the product of the photon&amp;#39;s energy and one half of the Compton cross-section per electron.  In quiescent solar corona, this heating starts in the transition zone to the corona and is a major fraction of the coronal heating.  Plasma redshift contributes also to the heating of the interstellar plasma, the galactic corona, and the intergalactic plasma.  Plasma redshift explains the solar redshifts, the intrinsic redshifts of stars, quasars, the galactic corona, the cosmological redshifts, the cosmic microwave background, and the X-ray background.  The plasma redshift explains the observed magnitude-redshift relation for supernovae SNe Ia without the big bang, dark matter, or dark energy.  It explains also the observed surface brightness of galaxies.  There is no cosmic time dilation.  The universe is not expanding. The plasma redshift, when compared with experiments, shows that the photons&amp;#39; classical gravitational redshifts are reversed as the photons move from the Sun to the Earth, provided they have adequate time to change their frequency.  This is a quantum mechanical effect.  As seen from the Earth, a repulsion force acts on the photons.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big Bang Creationism and Cosmology, despite still being popular in Christian countries as the dominant explanation has been debunked for over 50 years. &lt;strong&gt;Plasma Cosmology&lt;/strong&gt; is the only real game in town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the Doppler Theory of Redshift had been debunked, all the work of &amp;quot;Expanding Universe&amp;quot; Theoreticians that built their work on the idea of Doppler Redshift became instantly invalidated.

His thesis improved a) the frequency limits, b) the estimates of the Cherenkov radiation, and  c)  the estimates of the energy levels in the solid materials conventionally used for stopping power measurements.  These changes improved the theoretical estimates from about 1% to about 0.1%.  The best experimental accuracy is about 0.1%.\n\n* Dr., Brynjolfsson’s theory for the stopping of charged particles was useful for discovering the plasma redshift of photons in 1978.  The plasma redshift has been overlooked due to the approximations used and because this cross section is insignificant in laboratory experiments.  It is important only in very hot sparse plasmas, like those in the corona of the Sun and in intergalactic space.\n\nSpecial Studies:\n\n* Fellowship University of Reykjavik, Iceland, 1954–1955\n\n* Alexander von Humboldt Fellow University of Göttingen, Germany, 1955–1957\n\n* AMP, Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts, 1971\n\nPrimary Positions:\n\n* **Head** of Danish AEC Radiation Facilities at Risø 1957-1965, with focus on research and industrial applications of radiation\n\n* **Head** of **US Army** Radiation Facilities, Natick, Massachusetts, 1965-1980, with focus on research and industrial applications of radiation\n\n* Special Assistant for Physics, Natick, 1980-1988\n\n* **Director** of IFFIT of the Joint FAO/IAEA, **United Nations**, 1988-1992, with focus on international training and applications of radiation\n\n* **Director**, Applied Radiation Industries, Wayland, Massachusetts, 1992 - present\n\nAwards:\n\n* Møller Foundation Award for exceptional service to Danish Industry, 1965\n\n* “Radiation Science and Technology Award of the American Nuclear Society”, 1988\n\nhttp://plasmaredshift.org//Curriculum_Vitae.html\n\nAlso\n\nWho is Anthony Peratt and why do Big Bang Creationists fear him?\n\nAnthony L. Peratt (S'60, M'63, SM'85, F'99) received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1971 from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles.
