Hopefully we can all shit out some worthwhile compost and plant it in the respective gardens in our hearts, and eventually bear flowers of mutual understanding and perhaps even fruits of kinship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to start, my entire worldview basically stems from one premise: the absolute unity of being. Everything we can imagine, what we can call the &amp;#39;Many,&amp;#39; is varied. It is the fragmented universe, made up of things, words, ideas, energies, movement, etc. But Being itself is One. Being is the one Universal aspect, that which unites the Many into the One; all things share this very quality of being, and so there is only One Being, which is &amp;#39;being-ness&amp;#39; itself. &lt;em&gt;Zen&lt;/em&gt;, for example is the acknowledgement that through this fact, the universe is actually a great emptiness, because if everything is one, it has no context. This is different from nihilism which takes the next step of saying that everything is therefore meaningless, or nothingness, which are both different, and may not be the case. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt;, then, is a shorthand for Being. It is special because it is all-inclusive, but completely exclusive as well. Yes God is that lamp, but not just that, and then not really that at all, and when the lamp is gone it won&amp;#39;t be that anymore. Ibn &amp;#39;Arabi (whose philosophy I have studied and take many of my ideas from,) talks of Imminence and Transcendence, as two very important, complimentary and basic aspects of God. Though even saying that would be limiting God, which shouldn&amp;#39;t really be done, as you can understand, because Being is such an absolute quality. It can&amp;#39;t really be described, just introduced and pointed to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Unity in mind, we can begin to think of the Many in different ways. For example, we have separate phenomena in this Universe, and there is apparently a perfect order to it all, which itself even includes a balance of perfect chaos. This order is Spirit. Spirit is the movement of God, or the spiritual forms that God takes. By spiritual forms, I mean the archetypes or ideas of things. For example, every tree, though having an individual manifestation or Soul, also has a certain &amp;#39;tree-ness.&amp;#39; This is the spirit of a tree, that each tree shares and embodies in its individual soul. Humanity is the name we&amp;#39;ve given to the spirit that our individual souls embody as people. We all share it and express it through our individual existence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You often hear about past lives, and people believing that their soul has been this person or that in the past. From all I&amp;#39;ve discussed so far in this post it seems intuitive that this could happen in some sense. I do know a (basic) thing or two about quantum physics, and I know too that people like to hijack that theory. But we know that atoms that are a part of our body now has almost certainly been a part of nearly everybody and everything before a certain period of time. I do personally believe that through intense spiritual practice one can reach a state of consciousness where you are more in touch with God, or that common Being-ness that all things share, and that information about various entities can be gained through such a state. That is how I think astrology originated, especially the Vedic astrology which is still effective today. It&amp;#39;s really amazing how much control over the mind, body, and soul some of the master Yogis of the past have gained. But I digress and anyway it&amp;#39;s partly conjecture, however I still think many things possible that modern &amp;#39;science&amp;#39; denies is very much possible and happens. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Karma I feel is becoming more and more believable through the quantum model. Clearly consciousness has an effect on reality, and whether you believe in past and future lives or not, or in what way you do, your actions and attention manifest reality to some degree. Reality usually takes the form of Samsara, which is the wheel of death and rebirth. People commonly look at all these terms at a gross level, but these principles are at work in a very subtle way. Samsara is happening all the time, every day, indeed every moment. Everything is made of cycles. The concept of Samsara shows up in the fact that every day is born, lives, and dies. To be &amp;#39;caught&amp;#39; in samsara merely means to be caught in a dead routine. Liberation from this cycle means being truly free to act without bias in the moment. It happens when the individual soul transcends the spirit and becomes one with God. I imagine it&amp;#39;s really fucking hard to do, especially these days. We do get tastes though, and Love is the path towards this liberation. Ibn Arabi describes love as the movement towards beauty. For him beauty is &amp;#39;the meaning of life,&amp;#39; and the reason for existence. Being a Sufi, he said that beauty was the motivation for God to say the creative word &amp;#39;Hū,&amp;#39; which is comparable to the Sanskrit &amp;#39;Om,&amp;#39; that you hear in Yoga classes and Sanskrit prayers. It is called the breath of compassion, and both these words could roughly translate to the english imperative, &amp;#39;Be.&amp;#39; So the chef loves food in a very high way, because he transcends his individual soul and makes way for a new, beautiful manifestation. The eater of the food also loves the food, but in a different way, one that probably isn&amp;#39;t as beautiful because it&amp;#39;s not as creative. Depending on how we interact with samsara, or the cycles, we will create different karma, or patterns based on the force of our actions, which will in turn show up again in samsara. The more we perpetuate these patterns, the deeper ingrained they become. They can become so ingrained that we may pass them to the next generation..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A big point with this post is to point out that much of what we call religion today is actually politics, which is the art of controlling people. Actual religion is extremely personal. The word comes from the root &lt;em&gt;to tie&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;fasten&lt;/em&gt;. So religion has to do with tying oneself, in this case to truth, which is another way of saying Being, which is God as discussed. In this way science is a beautiful religion in principle, but like all world religions, it can make the mistake of being exclusivist, and as we all know pseudoscience is rampant, as is pseudoreligion in general. Sin is when we stray from our religion. It is an important part of discovering our boundaries. How can one know the middle path without seeing the edges? This is why it&amp;#39;s important to explore many possibilities and try to see from many perspectives. And that is why I have been digging Reddit since I discovered it a couple weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will end this rant here, but there is more to say, and probably I can be clearer about some things.

Thus, he paints a picture of the will such that rational beings who have worldly incentives, such as humans, don’t act directly from pure reason, but instead take constraints from it on which incentives we ought to follow. Particular constraints, or commands from reason, are called imperatives, of which there are two types: hypothetical and categorical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypothetical Imperatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hypothetical imperatives are imperatives that one has with respect to some other ends. For instance, if I have some end in mind like ‘bake a pie’, I have a hypothetical imperative to gather all the ingredients and tools involved in pie-making. Kant takes imperatives like this, or imperatives of skill, to be mostly uninteresting. Instead, the real fruit of hypothetical imperatives comes from our hypothetical imperatives about ‘perfect happiness’ (Gregor uses just ‘happiness’), something Kant thinks every rational being takes as an end (4:415). However, Kant argues that no one can have imperatives with perfect happiness as their end because of just how vague a concept it is. “There is no imperative possible which [...] could command us to do what will make us happy...” (4:418). So the only universal imperatives are categorical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categorical Imperatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hypothetical imperatives just won’t do as the principles of an objective moral theory for all rational beings, they’re either about things that not every rational being takes as an end (imperatives of skill) or about an end that is too vague to actually formulate any imperatives (hypothetical imperatives about perfect happiness). Instead, we need to turn to categorical imperatives, or imperatives that refer to no end beyond themselves. With this in mind, Kant outlines his project for the rest of the section (to be read for next week). That is, he wants to investigate &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; the possibility of a categorical imperative, from this investigation we should get our moral law. Kant takes this to be a synthetic &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; project, just as difficult as the one he attempted in the earlier &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion Q: Will Kant be sympathetic to objections against his moral theory such as “Kantianism suggests that you should turn over your family to a murderer”? How do you feel about that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion Q: Does Kant’s theory of morality being based in categorical imperatives, i.e. done not for your own happiness but out of duty alone square with your intuitions about the nature of morality? Does it provide a suitable answer to Glaucon’s challenge as given in Plato’s &lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt;, and if it doesn’t, should that count as a mark against Kant’s theory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to participate in discussion you &lt;strong&gt;don’t&lt;/strong&gt; need to address the above questions, they’re only there to get things started in case you’re not sure where to go. Discussion can continue for as long as you like, but keep in mind that we’ll be discussion the next section of reading in just one week, so make sure you leave yourself time for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Next Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For next Sunday please read the remainder of section 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"**ADefiniteDescription and I took the main points of this week's reading to be as follows:**\n\nFor this week we read the first half of the second section of the *Groundwork*.

So the only universal imperatives are categorical.\n\n**Categorical Imperatives**\n\nHypothetical imperatives just won’t do as the principles of an objective moral theory for all rational beings, they’re either about things that not every rational being takes as an end (imperatives of skill) or about an end that is too vague to actually formulate any imperatives (hypothetical imperatives about perfect happiness). Instead, we need to turn to categorical imperatives, or imperatives that refer to no end beyond themselves. With this in mind, Kant outlines his project for the rest of the section (to be read for next week). That is, he wants to investigate *a priori* the possibility of a categorical imperative, from this investigation we should get our moral law. Kant takes this to be a synthetic *a priori* project, just as difficult as the one he attempted in the earlier *Critique of Pure Reason*.\n\n**Discussion Q: Will Kant be sympathetic to objections against his moral theory such as “Kantianism suggests that you should turn over your family to a murderer”? How do you feel about that?**\n\n**Discussion Q: Does Kant’s theory of morality being based in categorical imperatives, i.e. done not for your own happiness but out of duty alone square with your intuitions about the nature of morality? Does it provide a suitable answer to Glaucon’s challenge as given in Plato’s *Republic*, and if it doesn’t, should that count as a mark against Kant’s theory?**\n\nIn order to participate in discussion you **don’t** need to address the above questions, they’re only there to get things started in case you’re not sure where to go. Discussion can continue for as long as you like, but keep in mind that we’ll be discussion the next section of reading in just one week, so make sure you leave yourself time for that.\n\n**For Next Week**\n\nFor next Sunday please read the remainder of section 2.","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f2oas","clicked":false,"title":"[Reading Group] Week Two of Kant's Groundwork","media":null,"score":41,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":8,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/philosophy/comments/1f2oas/reading_group_week_two_of_kants_groundwork/","name":"t3_1f2oas","created":1369585993,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1f2oas/reading_group_week_two_of_kants_groundwork/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"ReallyNicole","created_utc":1369557193,"ups":49,"num_comments":67,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":"moderator"},{"domain":"self.philosophy","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"philosophy","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between justice and revenge is a well-established trope.

Long read, but if you have any comments, I&amp;#39;d really appreciate them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We often hear &amp;quot;stealing&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;theft&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;piracy&amp;quot; in connection with digital file sharing. The use of these terms is seldom questioned, and sometimes even embraced by pioneers in the domain (e.g. The Pirate Bay). Such language implies criminality, wrongdoing, particularly violation of property rights. However, these terms lack objectivity, and bias discussions of the issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the moral status of digital file sharing? To begin with, it seems to me there are several ways it&amp;#39;s unlike theft...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No deprivation. If you steal Lucy&amp;#39;s car, Lucy no longer has a car. She is deprived against her will. This is what makes it criminal, and wrong. Digital file sharing, obviously, does not work this way. Files are replicated. The original owner does not go without.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The alleged victim ain&amp;#39;t even involved. Sal rips a U2 song to his hard drive, uploads the file. Bob downloads it. U2 has no part in this exchange. Suppose U2 sold Sal a car, and someone then stole the car. It would be strange if U2 considered Sal&amp;#39;s car being stolen as a violation against &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;, U2. How can one be victimized by an exchange one had no part in, and perhaps never even knew about?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consensuality. If you take someone&amp;#39;s car, but the owner wants you to have it, then you haven&amp;#39;t stolen it. Theft implies nonconsensuality. Digital file sharing is mutually voluntary.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sharing digital files is more akin to the familiar, morally unproblematic ways many of us share content. We invite friends over to watch a DVD, borrow someone&amp;#39;s book, play popular songs on the piano at a party, recite funny lines from movies, record TV shows and save them for group viewings. In the 80s and 90s, many people taped songs off the radio, or duplicated CDs on cassette, or taped TV shows on VHS. There was, and is, no sense of legal or moral impropriety about these things. Sharing and copying are part of the natural public response to creative content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, along comes the computer revolution...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which enables perfect and practically infinite replication of digital content, for anyone with a computer. Historically speaking, a miraculous technology. It causes a sea change to many industries traditionally based on sales of recorded content. It&amp;#39;s economically devastating. What types of things are marketable goods in an economy? Things that are scarce. There&amp;#39;s not a robust market for sea water, or common dirt, or air. Why? Because the supply of those goods is not limited enough. Why pay, when you can get it virtually for free? It&amp;#39;s rather incredible that highly sophisticated items like digital files have now entered this low-scarcity category, but they have. And this reality is what so many in the entertainment industry, and purveyors of digital content far and wide, have not come to terms with. And it&amp;#39;s understandable that they haven&amp;#39;t, because it&amp;#39;s been &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a sea change, and it&amp;#39;s happened &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; fast.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stark fact is that today, &lt;em&gt;digital content is worthless&lt;/em&gt;. A Yo-Yo Ma recording, a Coen Brothers film, a Zadie Smith novel, a Ricky Gervais podcast... the moment these things are put in a digital format, they become worthless. Not worthless artistically or culturally, but economically. Record labels, movies studios, media companies formerly sold copies in physical form (LP, cassette, CD, VHS, DVD, etc.) What has become clear is that, all along, they were really selling the physical substrate, which had to be manufactured, transported, packaged, handled, displayed in a retail store. All that processing was costly, which made the products scarce, which gave them market value. And people working in those industries conflated the creative content with the physical substrate, and believed they were selling the former rather than the latter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, along comes the backlash...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Record labels, movie studios, media companies... everyone had gotten used to the revenues generated by the physical sales model, and had vested interests in its survival. And this is basically still the situation we are in today. Although we&amp;#39;ve shifted somewhat from physical content and toward digital, the sales mechanisms of old have largely remained intact. Instead of buying ink-and-paper books, we now buy e-books. Instead of paying for physical CDs and DVDs, we now pay for digital downloads or streaming privileges. Copyright laws remain essentially unchanged. It&amp;#39;s still illegal, and &lt;em&gt;morally bad&lt;/em&gt; to share copyrighted digital content. And yet, it&amp;#39;s widely done anyway. There are robust underground file-sharing networks. And despite copyright protections, purveyors of digital content have almost invariably seen their revenues fall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now try on this thought experiment. Imagine someone invented a Swim Cap Replicator, a machine that could replicate swim caps indefinitely. A million, a billion caps... no limit. You enter the design you want and push the &amp;quot;Replicate&amp;quot; button. And suppose anyone who wanted this machine could buy one at a reasonable price. A marvelous invention, and a great boon to the swimming community. How fast would the market for swim caps dry up? Very fast, I think. Suppose swim cap sellers, concerned to preserve their source of income, raised hell, objecting to these machines, and launched a campaign to ban them. Would it be reasonable, as a society, to ban them? Well, consider what we&amp;#39;d be doing by banning them. We&amp;#39;d be telling the community: &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be so abundant in resources. Don&amp;#39;t enjoy the fruits of this technology. Cope with less.&amp;quot; And we&amp;#39;d simultaneously be driving swim cap replication underground, and turning those who used these machines into criminals. I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;d want to ban such a machine, or its use. Yes, it&amp;#39;d be unfortunate for those swim cap makers who&amp;#39;d take a hit financially, but we&amp;#39;d want to chalk that up to the &amp;quot;creative destruction&amp;quot; of human progress. Wouldn&amp;#39;t we? The swim cap as a viable source of revenue would go the way of the typewriter and mimeograph, and those swim cap production resources would be repurposed, and the world would be better for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The situation with digital file sharing is much the same, I think. The business model has had to change, and it has been changing. But what I&amp;#39;m concerned with is the legal and moral thinking on the issue, which has not evolved much. If it would be fine to strew the world with replicated swim caps, why is it not fine to share digital files? Even those who engage in file sharing often feel guilty, and that what they&amp;#39;re doing is wrong. So, what&amp;#39;s wrong with it, if anything?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure there&amp;#39;s anything wrong with it, but it is problematic in some ways. Many things could be said here. For one, there&amp;#39;s a widespread feeling that creators of intellectual content should be compensated. Often the work involved in creating such products is resource-intensive. A concert violinist spends years in training. A filmmaker might put several years of toil into a project, and spend a fortune producing it. A comedian might do shows for a year honing material in preparation for a DVD special. Talented people doing difficult work. They deserve to be paid. Similarly, there&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;trader principle&amp;quot; impulse, which is admirable enough. As in, &amp;quot;You created this thing I enjoy. I want to show my appreciation.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so, what usually happens when consumers are moved to compensate digital content creators is they pay the creator for the product, as if it were marketable. This is what goes on all the time with iTunes, CD Baby, Amazon Kindle, so on. I say &amp;quot;as if it were marketable&amp;quot; because, again, digital files are no longer scarce. And thus, payments like these are really &lt;em&gt;masked&lt;/em&gt; exchanges. They&amp;#39;re a pretense, a show, because the payment is really a donation, or an honorarium. It&amp;#39;s choosing to pay for something one could&amp;#39;ve got for free. And I&amp;#39;m okay with that as a payment model, except insofar as it perpetuates the illusion of scarcity, of digital files as marketable products. Thus it also perpetuates the conventional moral norms around all this. Those who buy the digital download are &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; (honest, praiseworthy), and those who get it for free are &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; (cheats, freeloaders).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; wise to adhere to the trader principle in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; fashion. I&amp;#39;m not sure it&amp;#39;s morally required of anybody in the context of non-scarce resources, but it&amp;#39;s admirable. Take the swim cap example again. Suppose someone designed a particular cap that you adore. There&amp;#39;s an infinite supply of this cap, thanks to the Replicator, but you&amp;#39;re moved to show your appreciation to this designer, because if not for him, this design wouldn&amp;#39;t exist. So you toss him a few ducats. A good and honorable thing to do, but hardly morally required. See, there&amp;#39;s virtue in transparency about what exactly we&amp;#39;re paying for. Such transparency helps alleviate guilt and clear the moral waters. The patronage model, a la Kickstarter, is one that avoids perpetuating the illusion of scarcity. Or rather, it focuses our attention on the &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; element of scarcity: the creators themselves. Great films are a benefit, something many people want to enjoy. Yet great filmmakers are scarce. So funding filmmakers in advance is an honest and direct way to trade for that benefit. Donations and honorariums are great too, if they&amp;#39;re framed as such.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about when a digital content creator views their own work as a saleable item? I believe this drives much of the guilt and shame around file sharing. If you freely download an album of a band who is charging for that album, this creates a tension with the band. Even if it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; theft, if the band would &lt;em&gt;interpret&lt;/em&gt; it as theft, there&amp;#39;s a problem. As a fan wanting to respect the wishes of the band, one might indulge the band and pay for the download, or feel guilty if one acquires it without paying. I&amp;#39;m not sure what to say about this kind of case, but it is a problem. Imagine a swim cap designer who was designing caps before the Replicator came out. One day he catches you wearing a cap bearing one of his designs. He asks if you paid for the cap. You say no, as you made it on your own machine. He&amp;#39;s pissed. Well, if you&amp;#39;re a kind-hearted soul, you might give him some money. But you&amp;#39;re under no moral obligation to do so, just like you&amp;#39;re under no obligation to shop at the struggling mom &amp;amp; pop grocery as against the Walmart down the road. But it&amp;#39;s kinda nice if you do once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Won&amp;#39;t creative work be underfunded? Who knows? But it hasn&amp;#39;t really happened yet. There&amp;#39;s more film, video, music, podcasts, software being produced than ever, much of it high quality too. Recorded content was always just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; source of revenue. For most of human history, musicians earned money through live performance, patronage, commissions, teaching. Hollywood&amp;#39;s golden age was funded by theatrical screenings, a scarce resource which is still viable. There&amp;#39;s still a demand for live theater, a scarce resource. Live shows are the lifeblood of comedy. Poets and novelists may have fewer options, and have to rely more on the pay-up-front model, or on what demand remains for ink-and-paper books, or on donations. But the salient question is, is it in anybody&amp;#39;s long-term interest to ban the Swim Cap Replicator? Is it right or fair to outlaw and demonize digital file sharing? I think it should be celebrated for the blessing that it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Hey y'all. I wrote this out because I wanted to sort out my own views.

And this is basically still the situation we are in today. Although we've shifted somewhat from physical content and toward digital, the sales mechanisms of old have largely remained intact. Instead of buying ink-and-paper books, we now buy e-books. Instead of paying for physical CDs and DVDs, we now pay for digital downloads or streaming privileges. Copyright laws remain essentially unchanged. It's still illegal, and *morally bad* to share copyrighted digital content. And yet, it's widely done anyway. There are robust underground file-sharing networks. And despite copyright protections, purveyors of digital content have almost invariably seen their revenues fall.\n \nNow try on this thought experiment. Imagine someone invented a Swim Cap Replicator, a machine that could replicate swim caps indefinitely. A million, a billion caps... no limit. You enter the design you want and push the \"Replicate\" button. And suppose anyone who wanted this machine could buy one at a reasonable price. A marvelous invention, and a great boon to the swimming community. How fast would the market for swim caps dry up? Very fast, I think. Suppose swim cap sellers, concerned to preserve their source of income, raised hell, objecting to these machines, and launched a campaign to ban them. Would it be reasonable, as a society, to ban them? Well, consider what we'd be doing by banning them. We'd be telling the community: \"Don't be so abundant in resources. Don't enjoy the fruits of this technology. Cope with less.\" And we'd simultaneously be driving swim cap replication underground, and turning those who used these machines into criminals. I don't think we'd want to ban such a machine, or its use. Yes, it'd be unfortunate for those swim cap makers who'd take a hit financially, but we'd want to chalk that up to the \"creative destruction\" of human progress. Wouldn't we? The swim cap as a viable source of revenue would go the way of the typewriter and mimeograph, and those swim cap production resources would be repurposed, and the world would be better for it.\n\nThe situation with digital file sharing is much the same, I think. The business model has had to change, and it has been changing. But what I'm concerned with is the legal and moral thinking on the issue, which has not evolved much. If it would be fine to strew the world with replicated swim caps, why is it not fine to share digital files? Even those who engage in file sharing often feel guilty, and that what they're doing is wrong. So, what's wrong with it, if anything?\n\nI'm not sure there's anything wrong with it, but it is problematic in some ways. Many things could be said here. For one, there's a widespread feeling that creators of intellectual content should be compensated. Often the work involved in creating such products is resource-intensive. A concert violinist spends years in training. A filmmaker might put several years of toil into a project, and spend a fortune producing it. A comedian might do shows for a year honing material in preparation for a DVD special. Talented people doing difficult work. They deserve to be paid. Similarly, there's a \"trader principle\" impulse, which is admirable enough. As in, \"You created this thing I enjoy. I want to show my appreciation.\" \n\nAnd so, what usually happens when consumers are moved to compensate digital content creators is they pay the creator for the product, as if it were marketable. This is what goes on all the time with iTunes, CD Baby, Amazon Kindle, so on. I say \"as if it were marketable\" because, again, digital files are no longer scarce. And thus, payments like these are really *masked* exchanges. They're a pretense, a show, because the payment is really a donation, or an honorarium. It's choosing to pay for something one could've got for free. And I'm okay with that as a payment model, except insofar as it perpetuates the illusion of scarcity, of digital files as marketable products. Thus it also perpetuates the conventional moral norms around all this. Those who buy the digital download are \"good\" (honest, praiseworthy), and those who get it for free are \"bad\" (cheats, freeloaders).\n\nI think it *is* wise to adhere to the trader principle in *some* fashion. I'm not sure it's morally required of anybody in the context of non-scarce resources, but it's admirable. Take the swim cap example again. Suppose someone designed a particular cap that you adore. There's an infinite supply of this cap, thanks to the Replicator, but you're moved to show your appreciation to this designer, because if not for him, this design wouldn't exist. So you toss him a few ducats. A good and honorable thing to do, but hardly morally required. See, there's virtue in transparency about what exactly we're paying for. Such transparency helps alleviate guilt and clear the moral waters. The patronage model, a la Kickstarter, is one that avoids perpetuating the illusion of scarcity. Or rather, it focuses our attention on the *true* element of scarcity: the creators themselves. Great films are a benefit, something many people want to enjoy. Yet great filmmakers are scarce. So funding filmmakers in advance is an honest and direct way to trade for that benefit. Donations and honorariums are great too, if they're framed as such.\n\nWhat about when a digital content creator views their own work as a saleable item? I believe this drives much of the guilt and shame around file sharing. If you freely download an album of a band who is charging for that album, this creates a tension with the band. Even if it's *not* theft, if the band would *interpret* it as theft, there's a problem. As a fan wanting to respect the wishes of the band, one might indulge the band and pay for the download, or feel guilty if one acquires it without paying. I'm not sure what to say about this kind of case, but it is a problem. Imagine a swim cap designer who was designing caps before the Replicator came out. One day he catches you wearing a cap bearing one of his designs. He asks if you paid for the cap. You say no, as you made it on your own machine. He's pissed. Well, if you're a kind-hearted soul, you might give him some money. But you're under no moral obligation to do so, just like you're under no obligation to shop at the struggling mom &amp; pop grocery as against the Walmart down the road. But it's kinda nice if you do once in a while.\n\nWon't creative work be underfunded? Who knows? But it hasn't really happened yet. There's more film, video, music, podcasts, software being produced than ever, much of it high quality too. Recorded content was always just *one* source of revenue. For most of human history, musicians earned money through live performance, patronage, commissions, teaching. Hollywood's golden age was funded by theatrical screenings, a scarce resource which is still viable. There's still a demand for live theater, a scarce resource. Live shows are the lifeblood of comedy. Poets and novelists may have fewer options, and have to rely more on the pay-up-front model, or on what demand remains for ink-and-paper books, or on donations. But the salient question is, is it in anybody's long-term interest to ban the Swim Cap Replicator? Is it right or fair to outlaw and demonize digital file sharing? I think it should be celebrated for the blessing that it is.","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1evmah","clicked":false,"title":"Thoughts on file sharing","media":null,"score":36,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","edited":1369277299,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":22,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/philosophy/comments/1evmah/thoughts_on_file_sharing/","name":"t3_1evmah","created":1369304125,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1evmah/thoughts_on_file_sharing/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"respighi","created_utc":1369275325,"ups":58,"num_comments":74,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"youtube.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{"content":"&lt;iframe width=\"600\" height=\"450\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/vhENDsaxW1w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;","width":600,"scrolling":false,"height":450},"subreddit":"philosophy","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1ewiu9","clicked":false,"title":"Think for a Change: Anal Loves Tomatoes","media":{"oembed":{"provider_url":"http://www.youtube.com/","description":"Just because you don't like tomatoes doesn't mean you won't.

Or will it depend on the specific field of inquiry?\n\nSo again, just to spark a bit of discussion, I can give an indication of my (not particularly well-informed) views; we can give non-empirical answers about especially necessity. What the scope of a scientific discovery is, seems to be beyond the discovery. Anyway, I'd be interested in hearing from some of the experts. I do apologise for this rather musing thread, but I thought a bit of free discussion would be fun.","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"17swrg","clicked":false,"title":"What are the metaphysical questions that cannot be answered scientifically and why can't they?","media":null,"score":5,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2w8ah","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/analyticmetaphysics/comments/17swrg/what_are_the_metaphysical_questions_that_cannot/","name":"t3_17swrg","created":1359888754,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/analyticmetaphysics/comments/17swrg/what_are_the_metaphysical_questions_that_cannot/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"fitzgeraldthisside","created_utc":1359885154,"ups":5,"num_comments":1,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"m-phi.blogspot.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"analyticmetaphysics","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"17sb70","clicked":false,"title":"Achievements of Analytic Metaphysics","media":null,"score":6,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2w8ah","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/analyticmetaphysics/comments/17sb70/achievements_of_analytic_metaphysics/","name":"t3_17sb70","created":1359858129,"url":"http://m-phi.blogspot.com/2012/07/list-of-achievements-of-analytic.html","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Dylanhelloglue","created_utc":1359854529,"ups":6,"num_comments":0,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"dropbox.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"analyticmetaphysics","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"17sar6","clicked":false,"title":"\"What is the Problem of Universals?\" by Gonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra","media":null,"score":3,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2w8ah","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":1,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/analyticmetaphysics/comments/17sar6/what_is_the_problem_of_universals_by_gonzalo/","name":"t3_17sar6","created":1359857689,"url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/x2vtv84uzfpf5co/2660134.pdf","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Dylanhelloglue","created_utc":1359854089,"ups":4,"num_comments":0,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.askphilosophy","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"askphilosophy","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love r/askphilosophy.

What if I, as someone raised in a society where a 15-year-old is considered sexually mature, moved to another country where the age of consent was 21.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would a sexual relationship against that law then be immoral?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem, in my mind, is dealing with multiple variables. A brief list of possible factors in determining the morality (by my definition) of a sexual relationship:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ability of both partners to control what happens in the relationship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ability of both partners to terminate the relationship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual maturity of both partners - Since infants are not suited for sexual relationships, there must, underlying this conflicting legislation, be an actual &amp;quot;suited age&amp;quot; for sexual maturity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional maturity of both partners - Again, it is clear to anyone that infants do not want, or understand, the concept of a romantic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel as if points #3 &amp;amp; #4 are the contested points between different cultures. My definition of &amp;quot;moral&amp;quot; does peg a lot of cultural conceptions of &amp;quot;marriage&amp;quot; as immoral, since one partner (usually female) or both is not ensured the right to terminate the marriage arrangement worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel as if there is more than one moral problem in determining the &amp;quot;moral&amp;quot; (rather than legal) age of consent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One is, of course, ensuring that both partners benefit from the relationship. The other stems from trying to control such relationships with law. If we say, for example, that we could determine the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; age of consent to be 14. In that case, those societies that placed their age of consent above 14 would be guilty of depriving a potentially mature human being the important human right of choosing one&amp;#39;s own sexual partners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if a country placed it under 14, they would be placing individuals in a situation that is inherently harmful to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to further disturb any rational debate of the issue, we have to consider that cultural factors also contribute to emotional maturity. If someone is raised in a culture that considers sexuality acceptable from a very early age (by the standard of other cultures), then the individuals of that culture will not believe that they are being harmed by the activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, those raised in a culture that prohibits sex until a very late age (say, 21), might feel that the activity is &amp;quot;taboo&amp;quot; or harmful, even if the activity itself isn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So with this, we face two core problems:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the appropriate age or biological step of development where humans should be given the liberty to choose their own sexual partners?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can acting on the conclusion of the first question in a society where the social age of consent is higher be harmful, even if we determine that both parties of the relationship are of (logically) appropriate age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope my argument is clear. I have discovered that this is a topic that people refuse to rationally debate at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you will look above your personal feeling on the matter and try to clearly express your opinion about the problem I have submitted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"I suppose, in order to begin this argument, that I must define \"morality\" for the purpose of our conversation.

And that&amp;#39;s why we need to be able to compensate people who are willing to give a kidney to a stranger, to save a life.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; For example, today you could decide to give a kidney. You&amp;#39;d be called a Good Samaritan donor. ... The only difference in a model that I&amp;#39;m thinking about is where you go and give your organ, and your retirement account is wired $40,000, end of story.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And where is the money going to come from? Apparently, in this case, money magically appears to save a life. END OF STORY! STOP TALKING ABOUT IT. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, seriously, with that mentality, the government can make money by kill prisoners and harvest their organs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even then, how can the poor possibly pay 20-40K for a kidney? I mean we are talking about money here, and the $40,000 is going to be billed to the person who needed the kidney, am I right? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Amy Friedman&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My position is that development of a legal, regulated mechanism for donor compensation is the only means of effectively eliminating the demand for this covert activity, closing down the black market and improving safety for donors and recipients.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is false. Legalizing and regulating &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;does not guarantee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the safety of donors and recipients, it just legalizes it. There is no guarantee that market in organs wouldn&amp;#39;t inevitably lead to abuses by corporations, by lobbyists, or by government officials either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who buys drugs from the black market?

Ways of being a person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The article &lt;a href=\"http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcbiopolitics2.htm\"&gt;&amp;quot;Making Up People&amp;quot; by Ian Hacking&lt;/a&gt; is, I think, the best place to begin understanding my premises.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is that people are not &lt;em&gt;born&lt;/em&gt; this way or that way (contrary to what Ms. Gaga professes) so much as they are “made up” or “dressed up” this way or that way.  For instance, one is not born, but rather becomes, a lawyer.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I imagine that this is an easy notion to agree with for most for you, but can you also agree with the statement &lt;a href=\"http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/\"&gt;“[o]ne is not born, but rather becomes, a woman”&lt;/a&gt; as easily?  What about the same statement made of men? of ethnic groups?  If so, you’re probably a feminist, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind this thinking is that people can’t just &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;, period.  They have to be &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;.  Who that someone turns out to be occurs through the interplay of &lt;em&gt;both society and individual&lt;/em&gt;, not through just one or the other.  Being a woman requires a society plus an individual just as much as being a lawyer requires those things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It used to be that the options for who some people could be were incredibly limited.  Peasants couldn’t be kings, black people couldn’t be president, etc.  Indeed, people even believed that you were born into your occupation.  People &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; born to be lawyers or bakers or derelicts.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the last 100 years, but especially in the last 50, we’ve come to rethink the eternal nature of such roles entirely.  We have come to see the limited options for who we can be as oftentimes arbitrary and constructed by ruling groups, and we have come to value a society that opens up for us a whole vista of possibilities, equally, for everybody.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people are a little more conservative about this point of view than others, though.  While they accept a lot of the historical arbitrariness of roles, they ask us to rethink the extent to which a lot of the limitations we face concerning our identities is the result of economic realities and not just arbitrary judgments.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is an economic reality, for instance, that I cannot become a lawyer until I go to four years of college and then law school.  It can’t happen overnight.  You can even say that it is an “economic reality” that I cannot be an ethnic Zulu if I was born as a white person in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most debates in politics stem from this difference in sensibility.  Some see our menu of social roles as too arbitrary and servicing of higher orders.  Others view the porridge as just right, so to speak, since our options reflect the economic realities of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, since I’m not here to talk about the Left-Right dichotomy, allow me to choose one without presenting a giant case for it.  After all, the player of an RPG must choose a class before setting out for an adventure.  So I choose Leftist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ii. Patriarchy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, we may now ask ourselves (thus finally getting on with the topic!) to what extent is gender arbitrary and servicing of dominant groups, if at all?  How is this arbitrariness and exploitation organized, if at all?  &lt;em&gt;But the most important question to ask is, how would a feminist answer the above two questions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This particular feminist will answer them as follows: (1) there persists &lt;em&gt;presently and rampantly&lt;/em&gt; a reasonable degree of arbitrariness and exploitation in certain gender roles, and (2) this is organized around a patriarchy (or patriarch&lt;em&gt;ies&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of people, especially on the Left, agree with my (1) but not my (2).  They say that gender arbitrariness is not as easy to parse out as that.  I hope to show that there really isn&amp;#39;t a distinction in agreeing with (1) but not (2).  If we agree that wherever arbitrariness exists, it usually indicates some sort of dominating group of people accessing this arbitrariness for gain, then we should agree that it is important to name this group, even if people do not enter into this group permanently, but rather float in an out of it through their actions.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Patriarchy is the mechanism by which people may be included in the group who benefit from the arbitrary and unequal terms of gender.  It is not the group itself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, this is why it might seem at first that feminists are suggesting that the group most benefiting from arbitrary gender roles is men &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; (and that they are therefore &amp;quot;man-haters.&amp;quot;).  This isn’t so.  A given patriarchy does not equal a given collection of men.  It is not the set of all men.  Indeed, patriarchy does not equal any collection of individuals at all.  Women can be just as patriarchal as men, given the opportunity and payouts for doing so.  (Think of conservative housewives who preach about where a “woman’s place” is.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good analogy would be drawing a powerful card in a game of &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt;.  The Patriarchy Card is incredibly useful if it arises in certain games.  You’ll probably win that specific game if it is drawn and played (given the presence of the appropriate land card, of course).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The difference, however, is that The Patriarchy Card can be played without every showing up on the table.  It can be &amp;quot;sleeved.&amp;quot;  This is because, again, patriarchy isn&amp;#39;t the group.  It is the &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; of becoming a member of the group.  (Whereas genders like man and woman represent both the group &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the way of becoming members of the group.)  In other words, patriarchs don&amp;#39;t exist, just patriarchy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, you might be asking, “If anybody can technically manipulate patriarchy in a given situation, if anybody can be a secret patriarch, why the suffix &lt;em&gt;patri-&lt;/em&gt;?  Why the emphasis on masculinity over femininity?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here we must underscore &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt;.  Actual “gameplay” suggests that men have greater access to The Patriarchy Card in their “decks” more than women (to keep with our &lt;em&gt;Magic&lt;/em&gt; analogy).  That is to say, men receive more frequent access to a position whereby one may leverage whatever weaknesses exist in gender roles at that time than women.  This is itself a weakness in the gender woman, one which has not been proved to be a necessary part of being a woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The natural follow-up question to all of this is, of course, what about systems that reward people at the exclusion of being a man?  What about mechanisms for manipulating your way to an enjoyable status on the sole basis of being a woman?  What about matriarchies?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The simple truth of the matter is that historians and anthropologists find it hard to point to any real-life examples of matriarchy.  For the most part, patriarchy has prevailed by a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; margin all over the world.  (About the closest thing to a matriarchy scholars know is the &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois#Women_in_society\"&gt;Iroquois culture&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is still much more to be said of patriarchy.  For now, however, I will let that monster sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iii.

If you agree with the above bullet points, you’re a feminist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"**i. Ways of being a person**\n\nThe article [\"Making Up People\" by Ian Hacking](http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcbiopolitics2.htm) is, I think, the best place to begin understanding my premises.  \n\nThe basic idea is that people are not *born* this way or that way (contrary to what Ms. Gaga professes) so much as they are “made up” or “dressed up” this way or that way.  For instance, one is not born, but rather becomes, a lawyer.  \n\nI imagine that this is an easy notion to agree with for most for you, but can you also agree with the statement [“[o]ne is not born, but rather becomes, a woman”](http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/) as easily?  What about the same statement made of men? of ethnic groups?  If so, you’re probably a feminist, among other things.\n\nThe reasoning behind this thinking is that people can’t just *be*, period.  They have to be *someone*.  Who that someone turns out to be occurs through the interplay of *both society and individual*, not through just one or the other.  Being a woman requires a society plus an individual just as much as being a lawyer requires those things.\n\nIt used to be that the options for who some people could be were incredibly limited.  Peasants couldn’t be kings, black people couldn’t be president, etc.  Indeed, people even believed that you were born into your occupation.  People *were* born to be lawyers or bakers or derelicts.  \n\nIn the last 100 years, but especially in the last 50, we’ve come to rethink the eternal nature of such roles entirely.  We have come to see the limited options for who we can be as oftentimes arbitrary and constructed by ruling groups, and we have come to value a society that opens up for us a whole vista of possibilities, equally, for everybody.  \n\nSome people are a little more conservative about this point of view than others, though.  While they accept a lot of the historical arbitrariness of roles, they ask us to rethink the extent to which a lot of the limitations we face concerning our identities is the result of economic realities and not just arbitrary judgments.  \n\nIt is an economic reality, for instance, that I cannot become a lawyer until I go to four years of college and then law school.  It can’t happen overnight.  You can even say that it is an “economic reality” that I cannot be an ethnic Zulu if I was born as a white person in the United States.\n\nMost debates in politics stem from this difference in sensibility.  Some see our menu of social roles as too arbitrary and servicing of higher orders.  Others view the porridge as just right, so to speak, since our options reflect the economic realities of the time.\n\nNow, since I’m not here to talk about the Left-Right dichotomy, allow me to choose one without presenting a giant case for it.  After all, the player of an RPG must choose a class before setting out for an adventure.  So I choose Leftist.\n\n**ii. Patriarchy**\n\nWith that in mind, we may now ask ourselves (thus finally getting on with the topic!) to what extent is gender arbitrary and servicing of dominant groups, if at all?  How is this arbitrariness and exploitation organized, if at all?  *But the most important question to ask is, how would a feminist answer the above two questions?*\n\nThis particular feminist will answer them as follows: (1) there persists *presently and rampantly* a reasonable degree of arbitrariness and exploitation in certain gender roles, and (2) this is organized around a patriarchy (or patriarch*ies*).\n\nA lot of people, especially on the Left, agree with my (1) but not my (2).  They say that gender arbitrariness is not as easy to parse out as that.  I hope to show that there really isn't a distinction in agreeing with (1) but not (2).  If we agree that wherever arbitrariness exists, it usually indicates some sort of dominating group of people accessing this arbitrariness for gain, then we should agree that it is important to name this group, even if people do not enter into this group permanently, but rather float in an out of it through their actions.  \n\nPatriarchy is the mechanism by which people may be included in the group who benefit from the arbitrary and unequal terms of gender.  It is not the group itself. \n\nNow, this is why it might seem at first that feminists are suggesting that the group most benefiting from arbitrary gender roles is men *necessarily* (and that they are therefore \"man-haters.\").  This isn’t so.  A given patriarchy does not equal a given collection of men.  It is not the set of all men.  Indeed, patriarchy does not equal any collection of individuals at all.  Women can be just as patriarchal as men, given the opportunity and payouts for doing so.  (Think of conservative housewives who preach about where a “woman’s place” is.)\n\nA good analogy would be drawing a powerful card in a game of *Magic: The Gathering*.  The Patriarchy Card is incredibly useful if it arises in certain games.  You’ll probably win that specific game if it is drawn and played (given the presence of the appropriate land card, of course).\n\nThe difference, however, is that The Patriarchy Card can be played without every showing up on the table.  It can be \"sleeved.\"  This is because, again, patriarchy isn't the group.  It is the *way* of becoming a member of the group.  (Whereas genders like man and woman represent both the group *and* the way of becoming members of the group.)  In other words, patriarchs don't exist, just patriarchy.\n\nNow, you might be asking, “If anybody can technically manipulate patriarchy in a given situation, if anybody can be a secret patriarch, why the suffix *patri-*?  Why the emphasis on masculinity over femininity?”\n\nHere we must underscore *technically*.  Actual “gameplay” suggests that men have greater access to The Patriarchy Card in their “decks” more than women (to keep with our *Magic* analogy).  That is to say, men receive more frequent access to a position whereby one may leverage whatever weaknesses exist in gender roles at that time than women.  This is itself a weakness in the gender woman, one which has not been proved to be a necessary part of being a woman.\n\nThe natural follow-up question to all of this is, of course, what about systems that reward people at the exclusion of being a man?  What about mechanisms for manipulating your way to an enjoyable status on the sole basis of being a woman?  What about matriarchies?\n\nThe simple truth of the matter is that historians and anthropologists find it hard to point to any real-life examples of matriarchy.  For the most part, patriarchy has prevailed by a *huge* margin all over the world.  (About the closest thing to a matriarchy scholars know is the [Iroquois culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois#Women_in_society).)\n\nThere is still much more to be said of patriarchy.  For now, however, I will let that monster sleep.\n\n**iii. Final notes**\n\nIt is here where I must rest my weary typing fingers and end this post, not for any logical or narrative purpose, but merely due to an exhaustion of my own patience.  Such resignation is not uncommon in the discourse of feminism.  The topic will oftentimes exhaust you before you exhaust it.\n\nWe should nonetheless recap.\n\n* There are many ways of being in relation to the world, some which are masculine and others which are feminine.   \n\n* Most people encounter the terms upon which we may be this or that as predefined by society.\n\n* A masculine way of being in relation to the world enjoys a systematic position of privilege *insofar as being a man allows one to influence the terms upon which other people may be x or y more so than the other way around*.  This is called patriarchy.\n\n* Matriarchy, the feminine version of the above privilege, is logically possible ableit actually rare, if not altogether nonexistent.\n\n* The reason for this is not a destiny in genetics or some such other such facts, but rather a snowball effect stemming from single chink in women’s armor (which can be discussed later).\n\n* Patriarchy persists today.\n\nThat’s it.

And yet a depression gives the fabulously rich an opportunity to buy up our assets, with &amp;quot;pennies on the dollar&amp;quot;.

The devastation he inflicts on others with his war-making might then seem inconsequential, or might even seem justifiable as Racial Revenge.  Where a sane person sees hundreds of thousands of dead, our potentate sees a thinning of the ranks of an &amp;quot;Enemy Race&amp;quot;.  For him, the destruction wrought by his war-making has no more import than the destruction of an ant-hill.  Raised with such a cynical view of humanity, our influential sociopath might indeed be tempted to reap huge profits from the immiseration of others.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;. .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is no mere hypothetical or philosophical speculation.  Consider what the U.S. Empire did to Iraq.  This is a country that was:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;permitting the most intrusive U.N. inspections in history&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;disarming, while the U.S. assembled an invasion force on its borders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;desperately suing for peace and offering drastic concessions -- new elections, U.S.-run inspections&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What more could one ask for?  Nonetheless, the U.S. proceeded with &amp;quot;Shock and Awe&amp;quot;, followed by invasion and occupation.  A million Iraqis and 4,500 Americans were killed.  Four million Iraqis became refugees.  Entire cities were destroyed.  Civil war was instigated.  Countless innocent people were tortured and sexually abused.  And the pretext for creating this trillion-dollar holocaust was a deliberate lie -- as the &amp;quot;Downing Street Memos&amp;quot; demonstrate.  And now, the U.S. Empire is preparing to create an even bigger holocaust, and this too will be based on a cold-blooded lie.  This is evil so outrageous and brazen that one can scarcely imagine it.  We Americans have become imprisoned in this evil, so deeply imprisoned that escape seems impossible, unthinkable.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;. . &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet escape is possible.  It&amp;#39;s possible because it&amp;#39;s necessary.  Necessity is stronger than the system of illusions created by the Empire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first step is to identify the origin of the evil -- the genesis, the root.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evil people are often the product of childhood abuse, and evil cultures are likewise created by abuse.  Often, the abused individual will play upon our sympathy and our guilt.  Out of compassion or misplaced guilt, we give the alleged &amp;quot;Victim&amp;quot; a pass.  We withhold criticism.  We suppress our suspicions and misgivings.  In this way, the manipulative individual finds himself Beyond Criticism, Beyond Reproach.  He can get away with anything -- and so he does.  His evil is enabled by our compassion, our generosity, and our guilt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of the U.S., a veritable religion has been founded on cultural abuse -- abuse carried to the genocidal extreme.  We have turned abuse into an Infinite Eternal Absolute.  It has become the very Definition of an entire culture.  As soon as we enter this realm of Absolutes, we lose touch with reality.  In the real world, there is no such thing as Absolute Evil.  However evil certain human beings may be, Perfect Evil is humanly unattainable: Everything is a matter of degree.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is World War II that caused us to enter the Realm of Absolutes and become like Gods.  Because we imagined the Enemy to be Infinitely Evil, we came to see ourselves as Infinitely Good.  This &amp;quot;Exceptionalism&amp;quot; deprived us of the ability to criticize ourselves, see ourselves objectively, or keep our own corrupt politicians in check.  Though the Third Reich was actually beaten by the Soviet Union (75% of the fighting occurred on the eastern front), we see our empire as &amp;quot;Saving The World&amp;quot;.  Thus our government takes on the role of Christ, with bombs and missiles taking the place of love and justice.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there is a third element in this demonic triangle of Absolutes: The Infinite Ultimate Victim.  2,000 years ago, Christ played the role of victim, but Christ was also savior, with love transcending victimization and triumphing over evil.  Today, the mythos of the Crucifixion has been supplanted by the mythos of the Holocaust.   Here, we have a collective Victim -- millions of people -- with the human individual reduced to insignificance.  And here, in this cult of genocide, we see the triumph of evil over love. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How interesting.  In Old Testament times, God commands the Eternal Victims to commit genocide: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... do not leave alive anything that breathes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-- &lt;a href=\"http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=DEUT+20&amp;amp;language=english&amp;amp;version=NIV-UK\"&gt;Deuteronomy 20:16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now, in 1940 A.D., the god of genocide is once again on the throne, and the god of love is forgotten.  This transformation is fatal for our civilization.  If genocide is really the best we can hope for or achieve, then nothing means anything, and anything is justified.  If human beings are nothing more than genocidal madmen, then why go on living?  We might as well commit national suicide, while making war on the human race and killing &amp;quot;anything that breathes&amp;quot;.  Nihilism is non-viable.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are trapped inside this triangle of Absolutes -- idolizing the Infinite Victim, seeking perpetual revenge, living under the cloud of perpetual genocide, making war against imaginary Threats, Saving The World, destroying the world.  But the triangle is based on delusion.  The Absolutes do not actually exist.  In many cases, the people who claim to represent the Perfect Victim colluded with the Victimizer, then adopted the Victim pose to escape condemnation.  &amp;quot;Exceptionalism&amp;quot; is just another name for arrogance: Far from being a virtue, it is the cardinal sin, this notion that our government is God or Savior.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To free ourselves from this inner prison, it is enough to repudiate the world of absolutes and return to the world of reality and humanity, where each individual is a mixture of good and evil.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;. .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, the baleful influence of the Evil Empire pervades the planet: There&amp;#39;s no getting away.  So we might as well get used to living with this evil.   We will find that evil has a use or a function.  Evil exists:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To goad people out of their complacency, &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To give people an excuse to unite and abolish artificial differences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To enable people to understand struggles of the past&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To get people to think twice and overcome delusions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To induce people to seek out deeper spiritual resources&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The evil of the government reflects the confusion of the people.  As people become deeper, less complacent and better able to cooperate with one another, the evil abates.

Scientists seem to equate it with being &amp;quot;surprised.&amp;quot;  I think I can refine a bit more than that.  So I&amp;#39;d like to know what you all think, if there is something I should read, another place to post, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fundamental unit of humor is what I will call the Atomic Joke (Here, atomic means indivisible or fundamental).  A delivered joke contains one or more Atomic Jokes.  For example, a comedian might tell a story with a single punchline, but the story may actually contain several Atomic Jokes.  Very roughly, each Atomic Joke can correspond to what we commonly refer to as &amp;quot;layers&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;levels&amp;quot; of a joke (e.g. &amp;quot;wrong on so many levels&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what is an Atomic Joke?  There are 3 components:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The essence of an Atomic Joke is an error.  This is ambiguously stated intentionally, because the error may refer to anything from a misplaced comma to genocide.  Being surprised can certainly be considered an error, and surprise may even be one of the more common errors that underlie an Atomic Joke, but it is not the only one.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The second component is more of a criterion, as is the third.  The second component is &lt;em&gt;low consequences&lt;/em&gt;.  This means that in order for an Atomic Joke to be considered funny, the underlying error must be one who&amp;#39;s negative consequences are minimal.  Phrases such as &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s not funny ಠ_ಠ&amp;quot; and protestations of a joke being &amp;quot;in poor taste&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;too soon,&amp;quot; etc. stem from a failure of this criterion, at least in the speaker&amp;#39;s eyes.  An obvious, extreme example would be genocide, mentioned above.  While genocide is an error, it is one with very serious consequences, and is (for most) excluded from being funny.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The third component/second criterion is &lt;em&gt;relevance&lt;/em&gt;.  That is, the underlying error must matter in some way to the listener for him/her to find it funny.  For example, I personally hate puns.  The reason is that I do not find the mechanics of swapping phonemes, homograms, etc. particularly meaningful; I do not believe it says anything of importance.  I would argue that telling a more involved story, with details and descriptions, goes a long way toward beefing up this criterion.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a 4th element, but it is not a constituent of an Atomic Joke, rather to a delivered joke, and that is the &lt;em&gt;delivery&lt;/em&gt; of the joke.  I have the least insight into this component, because it is the most nebulous.  The best I can say is that it is a form of the relevance criterion; my matching the natural rhythms of one&amp;#39;s audience, one can reinforce a human connection, which in turn increases the perceived relevance.  I separate delivery from the other 3 criteria because there is only one delivery, while there may be multiple Atomic Jokes.  Atomic Jokes are NOT simply &amp;quot;mini-jokes&amp;quot; that are told in succession leading up to the &amp;quot;big joke.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some notes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There is an obvious tension between Components 2 and 3.  If relevance is too high, you risk making people &lt;em&gt;take the joke seriously&lt;/em&gt;, or attribute negative consequences that exceed their personal threshold for what it is acceptable to laugh at.  OTOH, if you dumb down the consequences too much, then the question of &amp;quot;why do I care, again?&amp;quot; comes up, which is a violation of component 3.  Having a sense of humor is largely having an instinct for balancing these 2, and in a way that your audience will appreciate.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the common case where a delivered joke has multiple Atomic Jokes, it is common for the same fact to contribute to different components of different Atomic Jokes.  For example, in a Bugs Bunny cartoon, Bugs may make a political allusion, like comparing Yosemite Sam to McCain (work with me here).  There are now at least 2 Atomic Jokes: The absurdity of the cartoon, and the political statement.  Bugs&amp;#39; comment enhances the absurdity (C1, absurdity is an error) since he&amp;#39;s a goddamn cartoon rabbit, talking about a real-world political figure.  But the political commentary &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is its own AJ, and the fact that Bugs made a comment about the real world is a win for relevance.  The error, of course, is that a real person is being compared to a carton character.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It is possible for one component to be so strong or so weak, that it influences other components and other jokes.  In order for an AJ to work, you MUST have all 3.  If an AJ fails too spectacularly, you risk it contaminating the entire delivered joke.  This is one of every comedian&amp;#39;s worst nightmares: that he/she will be on a roll, make one off-color comment that is a Total Failure on (probably) component 2, and the spell of performance is shattered.  OTOH, if you feed one of the components steroids, you can get away with skimping on others.  This, IMHO, is one of the reasons silly-type cartoons work so well (or not at all): they jack up the absurdity, the error component is absolutely pervasive, so other deficiencies are overlooked.  The people that &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t get&amp;quot; cartoons are the ones for which this absurdity is not a relevant error, and so it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how over-the-top it is; in fact, the more crazy, the less they find it funny.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For some people, if an error has no significant negative consequences, it is irrelevant.  By definition of their worldview, they &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; find anything funny, because of the way funny is defined.  The more survival-based you are, the more this will be so.  This is also why it&amp;#39;s always assumed that teaching an AI humor will be one of the hardest things to do.  We see it in sf and sci-fi all the time; the robot is always identifiable by its inhuman lack of a sense of humor, and seeming incapability of grasping the concept.  I don&amp;#39;t think I need to expound on the implications for religious or other extremists.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sometimes something like death, genocide, or other mass murder is found to be funny by someone.  There are AT LEAST TWO REASONS WHY, and confusing the two will and does cause unnecessary strife due to miscommunication and misunderstanding.  The first possible reason is that component 1 falls short; the person does not see it as an error, or at least not as serious an error (that would properly make it a socially unacceptable fulfillment of component 2).  That would be your garden-variety sociopath, or at least nationalist/racist/sexist/*-ist.  But the OTHER reason concerns what the person &lt;em&gt;actually sees&lt;/em&gt; as the error in a joke.  It is common for &lt;em&gt;the mere irreverence of telling a joke&lt;/em&gt; to be in error.  If it&amp;#39;s socially unacceptable, if it&amp;#39;s going to mess with peoples&amp;#39; minds, that&amp;#39;s an error.  Since it&amp;#39;s just talking, C2 is hit out of the park.  And it&amp;#39;s a very important topic, so C3 is taken care of as well.  Try to be mindful of a person&amp;#39;s motivations in this light.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what does everyone think?  I invite examples and challenges, such as &amp;quot;what would be the components in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; joke?&amp;quot;  Also, I just noticed that we have 1000*e readers, hooray! :-)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: ok, who ruined it? ಠ_ಠ&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"So I've been kicking around some thoughts on what the essence of humor really is.
