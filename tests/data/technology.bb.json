Thanks to Mobile and an attempt to make mobile and desktops similar in software stack (most) e.g Tizen, Ubuntu, Android (in some respect) we are seeing a lot of things coming back from Mobile to Desktops. Even if devices converge to let current desktop games appear on mobiles, I wouldn't be surprised (things like storage are solvable problems). And never forget about all these games coming to Linux (2014 is going to be even better than 2013).\n\nSince we are seeing an increasing interests on Linux Desktops (lightworks, steam), do you think Linux Desktop will rise and wipe every other platform? How much juice, does other propritory platform has against Linux (e.g In which ways can they be competitive, if Linux becomes popular) ? Are these efforts just only dipping the toe, or are companies like valve are really committed to bring Linux forward. What happens, if other platform loosen some of their encrouchments ? Does having open source platform, and educating more companies about it (steam, lightworks are examples for many of them) gives Linux much more advantage over other platform?\n\nWhat do you guys think? Will Linux rise? What are the shortcomings, that Linux still has to solve (don't just look it from Microsoft Office and Adobe photoshop point of view) ? Is it a wishful thinking?","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f67x0","clicked":false,"title":"Is Linux going to take over the world, or has it done already?","media":null,"score":8,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1a","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":13,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/linux/comments/1f67x0/is_linux_going_to_take_over_the_world_or_has_it/","name":"t3_1f67x0","created":1369733711,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1f67x0/is_linux_going_to_take_over_the_world_or_has_it/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"a-r-t","created_utc":1369704911,"ups":21,"num_comments":40,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"reddit.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"linux","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f5u1t","clicked":false,"title":"Linux artists!

Would Richard Stallman use this computer?\n\nThanks a lot ahead of time for any responses.","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f43bb","clicked":false,"title":"Trying to build a 100% free desktop computer / home server to the BIOS level; help needed [x-post /r/gnu]","media":null,"score":59,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1a","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":21,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/linux/comments/1f43bb/trying_to_build_a_100_free_desktop_computer_home/","name":"t3_1f43bb","created":1369648496,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1f43bb/trying_to_build_a_100_free_desktop_computer_home/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Habstinat","created_utc":1369619696,"ups":80,"num_comments":67,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"johnflan.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"linux","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f388q","clicked":false,"title":"How to create a simple Linux kernel loadable module","media":null,"score":180,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1a","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":65,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/linux/comments/1f388q/how_to_create_a_simple_linux_kernel_loadable/","name":"t3_1f388q","created":1369617918,"url":"http://johnflan.com/2013/05/how-to-create-a-simple-linux-kernel-loadable-module/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"johnflanirl","created_utc":1369589118,"ups":245,"num_comments":8,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.linux","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"linux","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that really annoys me about the Linux desktop is that fact that most distros ship an older version of the Nvidia driver.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i.e - Its insane that Ubuntu don&amp;#39;t offer the latest drivers - Even the &amp;#39;experimental&amp;#39; packages are stale quickly...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take 319.17 - The majority of Ubuntu users will not get this version until 13.10....

however, I wasn&amp;#39;t sure that would reach anyone.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few of you will be able to related to this: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While in the shower (&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/fLO6ndH.jpg\"&gt;showerbeer&lt;/a&gt; causes this), I have ideas (when I&amp;#39;m not winning imaginary arguments). Many of these ideas are related to things I would love my phone and/or tablet to be able to do; most of those ideas relate to interacting with my surroundings, Lifelogging, and Self Tracking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An example of an idea I had from this morning&amp;#39;s scrub would be:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What if, when I entered my bathroom, it turns on the lights (if a photosensitive sensor deems it necessary.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I further brainstormed the idea further, and thought of a pop up display would ask if I would am going to take a shower. (this question could only be displayed if the alarm clock was recently silenced, or other conditions.) A servo could turn on the shower (and with a temperature sensor, set to a preferred temperature.) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With an Arduino, a Bluetooth module, a servo, a home automation light switch, a few other odds and ends, and some lines of if-&amp;gt;than statements in code, one could automate their morning. &lt;em&gt;(While typing this, I thought about a the lifelogging aspects of this; with the known rate of flow (usually printed on a showerhead) one could see how many gallons you used, and you could calculate in realtime, how much water you are using, how much a previous shower costed, achievement whoring of being &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/san4GUu.jpg\"&gt;&amp;#39;green&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook, ect.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few of these ideas I implemented. To accomplish some of them I&amp;#39;ve used Tasker, my home server, and an arduino.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last one I created was a system where when I wake up (via silencing my morning alarm on my phone): &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My phone reads aloud (via a Bluetooth connection to my multiroom speaker system) the current weather, if I have any meetings or events going on, and the news headlines. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The news (bbc.co.uk) and &lt;a href=\"http://fuckinghomepage.com\"&gt;FUCKING HOMEPAGE&lt;/a&gt; (which is a great way to start the day) are opened on my tablet. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If a few conditions are met (such as work not being on the calendar for the day) a popup on my phone asks if I would like to turn on my computer (via wake-on-lan.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another example would be:\nI used Tasker to write to a log file with the date and time when I turned my screen on and off. I took this data and used it for many things. (As a buddhist, I wanted to confront my dependence on my phone and I later had it crunch the raw data into a report that told me how many times I checked my phone that day so I could have a statistical view on how dependent I really was.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to think outside of the box &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/1dQII.jpg\"&gt;sometimes&lt;/a&gt;, and developing for myself is great; however, my friends are always telling me these awesome (and often, extravagant) ideas. \nSmall ideas are just as great as a large idea.

Many of these ideas are related to things I would love my phone and/or tablet to be able to do; most of those ideas relate to interacting with my surroundings, Lifelogging, and Self Tracking.\n\nAn example of an idea I had from this morning's scrub would be:\n\n&gt;What if, when I entered my bathroom, it turns on the lights (if a photosensitive sensor deems it necessary.) \n\n&gt;I further brainstormed the idea further, and thought of a pop up display would ask if I would am going to take a shower. (this question could only be displayed if the alarm clock was recently silenced, or other conditions.) A servo could turn on the shower (and with a temperature sensor, set to a preferred temperature.) \n\nWith an Arduino, a Bluetooth module, a servo, a home automation light switch, a few other odds and ends, and some lines of if-&gt;than statements in code, one could automate their morning. *(While typing this, I thought about a the lifelogging aspects of this; with the known rate of flow (usually printed on a showerhead) one could see how many gallons you used, and you could calculate in realtime, how much water you are using, how much a previous shower costed, achievement whoring of being ['green'](http://i.imgur.com/san4GUu.jpg) on Facebook, ect.)*\n\nA few of these ideas I implemented. To accomplish some of them I've used Tasker, my home server, and an arduino.\n\nThe last one I created was a system where when I wake up (via silencing my morning alarm on my phone): \n\n* My phone reads aloud (via a Bluetooth connection to my multiroom speaker system) the current weather, if I have any meetings or events going on, and the news headlines. \n* The news (bbc.co.uk) and [FUCKING HOMEPAGE](http://fuckinghomepage.com) (which is a great way to start the day) are opened on my tablet. \n* If a few conditions are met (such as work not being on the calendar for the day) a popup on my phone asks if I would like to turn on my computer (via wake-on-lan.)\n\nAnother example would be:\nI used Tasker to write to a log file with the date and time when I turned my screen on and off. I took this data and used it for many things. (As a buddhist, I wanted to confront my dependence on my phone and I later had it crunch the raw data into a report that told me how many times I checked my phone that day so I could have a statistical view on how dependent I really was.)\n\nIt's hard to think outside of the box [sometimes](http://i.imgur.com/1dQII.jpg), and developing for myself is great; however, my friends are always telling me these awesome (and often, extravagant) ideas. \nSmall ideas are just as great as a large idea.

If the sticker was where the white line is, this would not be a problem. \n\nIs there any way to still get my warranty, or am i SOL?","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f8u2l","clicked":false,"title":"Warranty void because sticker is missing...","media":null,"score":9,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2qlqh","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":3,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/Android/comments/1f8u2l/warranty_void_because_sticker_is_missing/","name":"t3_1f8u2l","created":1369825049,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1f8u2l/warranty_void_because_sticker_is_missing/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"granger744","created_utc":1369796249,"ups":12,"num_comments":21,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"engadget.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Android","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f6vd4","clicked":false,"title":"LG exec says the Company won't make the Nexus 5 in order to push LG Skinned Devices to Users","media":null,"score":220,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"http://f.thumbs.redditmedia.com/oVVzK-92K0hzUafS.jpg","subreddit_id":"t5_2qlqh","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":"userGreen","downs":157,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/Android/comments/1f6vd4/lg_exec_says_the_company_wont_make_the_nexus_5_in/","name":"t3_1f6vd4","created":1369761956,"url":"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/28/lg-kim-wong-we-wont-make-the-nexus-5/","author_flair_text":"Galaxy Note 2 LTE (N7105)","author":"sneakysaf","created_utc":1369733156,"ups":377,"num_comments":245,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.Android","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Android","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend is studying abroad and i&amp;#39;ve used a couple apps 24SMS, Jaxstr..

You either get a bigger phone or buy nothing. \n\n[gsmarena filter search](http://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?sName=&amp;idMaker=0&amp;idAvailability=1&amp;YearAnnounced=0&amp;nPriceLow=0&amp;nPriceHigh=0&amp;idCurrency=0&amp;idFormFactor=0&amp;idSIMType=0&amp;idDualSIM=0&amp;idQwerty=0&amp;HeightMax=0&amp;WidthMax=0&amp;ThicknessMax=0&amp;WeightMax=0&amp;idOS=8&amp;idOSVersion=0&amp;idOSWhen=0&amp;nminCPUMHz=1000&amp;nCPUCores=0&amp;nminRAMMB=500&amp;nminInternalStorageMB=0&amp;idExpansionCard=0&amp;idDisplay=0&amp;nminDisplayX=0&amp;nminDisplayY=0&amp;nmaxDisplayX=0&amp;nmaxDisplayY=0&amp;fminDisplaySize=3.8&amp;fmaxDisplaySize=4.0&amp;nPixelDensity=0&amp;idDisplayTech=0&amp;idTouchscreen=0&amp;idAccelerometer=0&amp;idGyro=0&amp;idCompass=0&amp;id35mm=0&amp;idCamera=0&amp;idCameraFlash=0&amp;idVideoRecorder=0&amp;idSecondaryCamera=0&amp;idGPS=0&amp;bWLAN=0&amp;idNFC=0&amp;bEDGE=0&amp;bGPRS=0&amp;idBluetooth=0&amp;bIR=0&amp;bEmail=0&amp;bWAP=0&amp;bJava=0&amp;idRadio=0&amp;bMMS=0&amp;idRingtones=0&amp;sColor=&amp;nBatteryCapacity=0&amp;StandBy=0&amp;TalkTime=0&amp;sFreeText=)","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f8upm","clicked":false,"title":"Where are the 4\" android phones?","media":null,"score":9,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2qlqh","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":26,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/Android/comments/1f8upm/where_are_the_4_android_phones/","name":"t3_1f8upm","created":1369825536,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1f8upm/where_are_the_4_android_phones/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"captivatelover","created_utc":1369796736,"ups":35,"num_comments":62,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"product-reviews.net","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Android","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f6sy6","clicked":false,"title":"Samsung Galaxy S4 2013 ad is a creative winner","media":null,"score":229,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"http://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5kzAz595A6IcmZ_2.jpg","subreddit_id":"t5_2qlqh","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":111,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/Android/comments/1f6sy6/samsung_galaxy_s4_2013_ad_is_a_creative_winner/","name":"t3_1f6sy6","created":1369757252,"url":"http://www.product-reviews.net/2013/05/28/samsung-galaxy-s4-2013-ad-is-a-creative-winner/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"kolembo","created_utc":1369728452,"ups":340,"num_comments":52,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"reviews.cnet.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Android","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f7640","clicked":false,"title":"Hisense Sero 7 Pro: Hands On With The $99 Android Tablet","media":null,"score":77,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"default","subreddit_id":"t5_2qlqh","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":33,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/Android/comments/1f7640/hisense_sero_7_pro_hands_on_with_the_99_android/","name":"t3_1f7640","created":1369778369,"url":"http://reviews.cnet.com/tablets/hisense-sero-7-pro/4505-3126_7-35771034.html","author_flair_text":null,"author":"memoryfailure","created_utc":1369749569,"ups":110,"num_comments":32,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"pbs.twimg.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Android","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f98lr","clicked":false,"title":"Toca Boca Salon coming soon to android, hopefully that means the rest of their apps will follow, my son loves toca band on my brother's iPad","media":null,"score":3,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/BJ3EewWpw2dO8Uox.jpg","subreddit_id":"t5_2qlqh","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":"userTeal","downs":1,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/Android/comments/1f98lr/toca_boca_salon_coming_soon_to_android_hopefully/","name":"t3_1f98lr","created":1369840884,"url":"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BLai7BeCQAArnwt.png:large | Great news from @tocaboca coming soon!
