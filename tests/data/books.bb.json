Those coupons are valid until June 16th and include 20% an item, and buy a Nook HD+ for $90 off.\n\nI am a BN member, but I didn't get the coupons, and this is the only way I hope to be able to afford a new Nook. \n\nIf you received those coupons in the mail and don't plan on using the $90 off a Nook HD+ one, would you be willing to message me the code on the back of the coupon? It would allow me to finally upgrade my first generation Nook as well as be able to afford it!\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this. I really appreciate it!","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f93q6","clicked":false,"title":"Barnes and Noble Members...?","media":null,"score":9,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/books/comments/1f93q6/barnes_and_noble_members/","name":"t3_1f93q6","created":1369834221,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1f93q6/barnes_and_noble_members/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"sincerelyKatie","created_utc":1369805421,"ups":9,"num_comments":10,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"npr.org","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"books","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f7wsv","clicked":false,"title":"Stephen King On Growing Up, Believing In God, And Getting Scared (from Fresh Air)","media":null,"score":53,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/L92_1DmOsbEkeDFa.jpg","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":10,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/books/comments/1f7wsv/stephen_king_on_growing_up_believing_in_god_and/","name":"t3_1f7wsv","created":1369799762,"url":"http://www.npr.org/2013/05/28/184827647/stephen-king-on-growing-up-believing-in-god-and-getting-scared","author_flair_text":null,"author":"canquilt","created_utc":1369770962,"ups":63,"num_comments":4,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.books","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"books","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since he was not a native speaker how is it possible to get so good ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Since he was not a native speaker how is it possible to get so good ?\n","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1fa200","clicked":false,"title":"Does anybody know how exactly Joseph Conrad got so good at writing ?","media":null,"score":0,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":"graphic-novels","downs":1,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/books/comments/1fa200/does_anybody_know_how_exactly_joseph_conrad_got/","name":"t3_1fa200","created":1369876539,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1fa200/does_anybody_know_how_exactly_joseph_conrad_got/","author_flair_text":"Graphic Novels","author":"colddarkworld","created_utc":1369847739,"ups":1,"num_comments":6,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.books","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"books","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom has been searching for this book she read years ago about a little girl named willamina, Willa for short.

Are Melville and Ishmael synonymous?\n\n*Nota bene*: This post inspired by the second point made in /u/bob_kindles [Author vs. Speaker post](http://redd.it/1f2d6i)","likes":null,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","id":"1f5zg9","clicked":false,"title":"Are Melville and Ishmael synonymous?","media":null,"score":35,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhps","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":"discussion","author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":17,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/literature/comments/1f5zg9/are_melville_and_ishmael_synonymous/","name":"t3_1f5zg9","created":1369726217,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1f5zg9/are_melville_and_ishmael_synonymous/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"TheRedWhale","created_utc":1369697417,"ups":52,"num_comments":38,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"news.nationalgeographic.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"literature","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f5yv3","clicked":false,"title":"Travel Writer Paul Theroux’s Last Trip to Africa.","media":null,"score":33,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhps","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":5,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/literature/comments/1f5yv3/travel_writer_paul_therouxs_last_trip_to_africa/","name":"t3_1f5yv3","created":1369725661,"url":"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/05/130525-paul-theroux-africa-travel-last-train-to-zona-verde/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"NinjaDiscoJesus","created_utc":1369696861,"ups":38,"num_comments":3,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.literature","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"literature","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read Bunin&amp;#39;s short story &amp;quot;Camargue&amp;quot;, a brief description of a particular woman that&amp;#39;s sitting on the same train as the narrator.

You should appreciate the proper working and correct killing of a bull that it is impossible to be brilliant with. A bullfighter will not be better than his audience very long.

If a really good bullfighter is to come and to remain honest, sincere, without tricks and mystifications there must be a nucleus of spectators that he can play for when he comes.

I am not adverse to some sci-fi and the occasional novel as I have read Shantaram and thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nI wouldn't mind learning about a new topic in depth such a period of history or culture as well. \n\nIts a pretty broad request in terms of genres and subject but I hope some other people can pick out some gems from what people recommend.\n\nThank you in advance.\n","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1fas74","clicked":false,"title":"1.5 years of reading list.","media":null,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/books/comments/1fas74/15_years_of_reading_list/","name":"t3_1fas74","created":1369896416,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1fas74/15_years_of_reading_list/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"wholebrazilnuts","created_utc":1369867616,"ups":1,"num_comments":2,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"io9.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"books","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1faqna","clicked":false,"title":"We lost a Grand Master today: Jack Vance has passed away.","media":null,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"http://f.thumbs.redditmedia.com/QV8qSRPUfQFExecY.jpg","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":"fantasy","downs":0,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/books/comments/1faqna/we_lost_a_grand_master_today_jack_vance_has/","name":"t3_1faqna","created":1369895151,"url":"http://io9.com/weve-lost-another-grand-master-r-i-p-jack-vance-191-510346926","author_flair_text":"A Memory of Light","author":"Halaku","created_utc":1369866351,"ups":1,"num_comments":0,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"i.imgur.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"books","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1faqci","clicked":false,"title":"Hey Reddit, can someone tell me where I'd find out if these books are worth anything?","media":null,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"http://f.thumbs.redditmedia.com/WhrpuLG1ocplBiUw.jpg","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/books/comments/1faqci/hey_reddit_can_someone_tell_me_where_id_find_out/","name":"t3_1faqci","created":1369894909,"url":"http://i.imgur.com/n2N865g.jpg","author_flair_text":null,"author":"UmAndUhh","created_utc":1369866109,"ups":1,"num_comments":0,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.books","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"books","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my English class, I need a short story and non-fiction based around the theme of the effect of racism on the oppressed and oppressors.
