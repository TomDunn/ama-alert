I&amp;#39;m not sure how many people have heard about banger rallies but in case anybody hasn&amp;#39;t here&amp;#39;s the info on them and what I might plan.  Banger rallies are challenge based driving rallies where you drive a couple legs over a couple days in vehicles that usually cost $500 or less.  These are will yield some of the best times in your life if you let it happen.  Ever wondered why it takes a week for two blokes in a car to get across a few states?  Banger Rallies are this type of adventure.  One of the more known ones is the &amp;quot;24 Hours of Lemons&amp;quot;.  I&amp;#39;ve never been in that one but I have participated in the BABE Rally for two years.  BABE stands for &amp;quot;Big Apple&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Big Easy&amp;quot; meaning you drive from New York to New Orleans in your shit box.  The challenges along the way can vary but usually involve you taking a picture of various objects along the way to get points so that you can win.  Speed/getting to the end first does not get you any points.  Some examples of challenges, 1. Pictures of road signs but they only give you a sliver of it and you have to re-create the rest if you see that sign along the way, 2. Take 6 pictures of cop cars, different jurisdictions, extra points if you get a cop to pose in front of said cars, 3. Three Pictures of Copper Ford Edges (this challenge frigging blew anus holes), 4. As many pictures of your team in front of the #1 pump at gas stations, 5. Every 2nd day is costume day and the challenge usually involves the costumes. This last year it was Little Bo Peep with Sheep and the sheep had to be grazing in fields on all fours with a fence in the background.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any ways... that&amp;#39;s the type of stuff I&amp;#39;m referring to when I say Banger Rally.  You have people breaking down, getting lifts from others, and people helping repair vehicles of others in the drunken parking lots of hotels.  With the BABE Rally ending this year I thought I might try and put something like the BABE Rally on and I&amp;#39;m looking for some input.

One of which I wanted to do was end the days in better places.  The BABE Rally days ended in no where back country land where there wasn&amp;#39;t anything to do and sometimes it was in a dry county.

American gas is cheap compared to Europe, is this the reason a lot of Americans (most Americans*) go for automatics?\n\n&gt;EDIT:\n&gt;This is a follow-up question for all drivers: Do you use the parking brake when parking?  Almost everyone I know doesn't bother, and I always shutter when I see their cars jerking back and fourth.","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f7yrl","clicked":false,"title":"Automatic Drivers: Do you ever wish you had a stick?

It was a 1988 Mazda Rx-7; Bright red with a grey leather interior. He paid $900 for it because it had an issue starting. The reason for this issue was a pin-hole in the apex seal. (For those of you who don’t know rotaries, this be bad juju) Anyway on the hottest day of the summer my brother decided to impress a girl with his new car. Low and behold the car with the plugged rad overheated; and the pressure caused that apex seal to give way. My brother of course called my father and we pushed him home in our van using a tire to buffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The car then sat in front of our house for about a week; before my father took pity on him and bought a non-running Blue base-model Rx-7 for $200. After reading up online my father realized the previous owner’s small oversight and managed to get it started. Surprisingly the apex seals were good and the engine ran like a top. The intention was to part out my brothers car; transferring the interior to the base model. But that’s not what ended up happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While driving with a friend who had just purchased a white 10th anniversary with a newly rebuilt engine; the friend attempted to overtake another car on the highway in the rain. Unfortunately the tires were bald and the extra oomph from that turbo sent the car into a slide. Before the slide could be corrected the rear wheel caught the whoops in the side of the road flipping the car onto its roof; where it slid for about 50 meters. The car was a write-off but the friend took his payoff and kept the car, intending to part it out. But my brother ended up (with the help of dad) buying the entire car for $800&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They stripped the 10th anniversary and put the engine and drive-train into my brothers Red Rx-7. This took my father working on the car for up to twelve hours a day. Between making lunches and dinners and driving us to school (Yes Dad was Mr., Mom and he was dam great at it) the stripped car was taken away for scrap within the week and my brothers car was completed a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR #1 ^ How the Blue Rx-7 Came into our possession.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dad had the blue car plated and on the road for next few years up until 2006. During this time he had used the spare parts from the stripped and (my brother’s next Rx-7 after he sold the red one) to convert it from a 4bolt to a 5 bolt, he also installed 3 piston calipers and upgraded the brakes. In 2006 my father decided to add a little more oomph to the little base model. Although not an all-together original idea he had a 1984 mercury cougar that he had bought new and paid for the undercoating. All that undercoating did was hide the rust, until it was too far gone to save. However that V8 and automatic transmission were still in tip-top shape. Dad decided it was to be put into the Mazda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However after getting the engine mounted, my mother and father lost their jobs. They did whatever they could to maintain the lifestyle we had keeping my sister in dance and my brother in hockey as well as helping him pay for school. This is how it has sat ever since. Our family has had money problems ever since as my sister and mother like to shop when they are upset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year both my grandparents on my mother’s side passed away. My grandmother from cancer and my grandfather from a stroke. He always said he would die first, as he didn’t want to live without her. My grandparents were rather wealthy having built a successful farm from the 1900s onwards. Their wealth was split between their three children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now being wealth and having acquired that wealth through inheritance my mother has decided to leave my father after 30 years of marriage. To clarify he has never hit her, never yelled always remembered her birthday and always taken her out for anniversaries. She says she never got her dream of a big two story house with a garage where she could park her new car that she would buy every two years. Apparently allowing her to have her career, while giving up his own to raise the children wasn’t good enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister no longer respects my father partly due to the way mother speaks about him to her. She constantly expects him to fix her car still, but has said hurtful things telling him it would be better for him to kill himself. I’ve never hit anyone but seeing the hurt in my dad’s eyes when she said that I nearly cold-clocked her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR #2 Money Troubles and dealing with people who should have become gold diggers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has never asked for anything in return for everything he has done for us. Always was happy to drive us wherever we needed and do anything that would make our lives easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore I want to give something back and I think finishing his car for him would be an excellent way to put a smile back on his face. While I have a basic working knowledge of cars and the tools to do the work I’ve never attempted something so extensive. Nor do I have any idea of where I should start.

It seem as though even though lots of people seem to throw the phrase counter steering around some people don't quite understand what it means. I think this is mainly due to lots of poorly half explained videos on youtube.\n\nBasically counter steering is the way which you **initiate** a turn by turning the bars in the opposite direction of the turn. It doesn't mean that during the turn you will be turning the wheel that direction. In contrast once you are in a consistent turn you will be turning (very slightly) in the direction of the turn. Remember this does not mean you may not have to apply force in the opposite direction (due to the bike trying to right itself), I just means that the direction your bars/wheel will be facing will be in the direction you want to turn.\n\nHere is an extract from [an article from the American Journal of Physics](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~fajans/pub/pdffiles/SteerBikeAJP.PDF):\n\nThe process of making a countersteered right turn can be broken into five somewhat arbitrarily divided steps:\n\n1. You **initiate** the turn by applying a torque to the handlebars, steering the front wheel to the left.\n\n2. The wheel steers to the left. The rate at which the steer-ing angle increases is set primarily by the moment of inertia I, of the wheel, fork, and handlebars around the steering axis, and by the \"trail\" (described later.)\n\n3. As the bike is now turning to the left, a centrifugal torque leans both you and the bike frame to the right. Gyroscopic action also leans the bike to the right, but, as I will show later, its effect is negligible.\n\n4. Transmitted by the fork, the increasing lean attempts to lean the front wheel over as well. For the first time, gyroscopic action becomes important, as the wheel responds to this \"leaning\" torque by attempting to steer to the right, thus counteracting the steering torque. The steering angle stops increasing.\n\n5. The leaning torque overcomes the steering torque and the wheel steering angle decreases. Note that the lean continues to increase because the bike is still turning left.\n\n6. As the bike has now acquired substantial leaning velocity, the lean increase cannot end instantly. **Driven by the still increasing lean, the wheel steering angle passes smoothly through zero and then points right. The centrifugal torques reverse direction, eventually halting the lean increase and balancing the gravitational torques. As no more leaning torque is applied to the wheel, the steering angle stabilizes, and the bike executes the desired right turn.**\n\nAlso a good [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countersteering#How_it_works) explains it (in slightly easier to understand language):\n\nWhen riding a bicycle or a motorcycle, deliberate countersteering is a method of **initiating a turn by a small, momentary turn of the front wheel, usually via the handlebars, in the opposite (counter) direction**. This moves the pivot point (the wheels' contact patches) out from under the center of mass to establish the lean angle for a turn.

He has a goldwing and I have an FJR, we both ride the hell out of our bikes.","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1faew6","clicked":false,"title":"Renting a bike in the rockies -- any suggestions for where to go / what to rent?","media":null,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi6d","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":"um","downs":0,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/motorcycles/comments/1faew6/renting_a_bike_in_the_rockies_any_suggestions_for/","name":"t3_1faew6","created":1369886296,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1faew6/renting_a_bike_in_the_rockies_any_suggestions_for/","author_flair_text":"Yamaha FJR 1300","author":"DocBrownMusic","created_utc":1369857496,"ups":1,"num_comments":1,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.motorcycles","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"motorcycles","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;whats normally done at the ~3600 mile mark on a bike?

I was coming into a L turn at around 5-10 mph and the front wheel came from under me. Now I am afraid to turn even if there are scattered rocks around, which makes for a very wide turn because I am trying to keep the motorcycle as straight as possible.

I hadn’t noticed any symptoms at all other than the check engine light.\nToyota found code P0741 Verified Failure, “found solenoid for torque convertor clutch stuck,” and told me I needed to replace my entire transmission for close to $5k. The person I spoke to said that the problem is my car is not switching to 4th gear, and when I drive those speeds, I should see my RPMs go really high. He said that probably I had put in the wrong transmission fluid at some point (more on this later.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted a second opinion, so I took my car over to Pep Boys, and they were able to verify the code, but said I’d have to go to a transmission shop for help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I searched online, and found a local shop with excellent reviews, and took my car there. The owner verified the code, and took my car for a test drive, which didn’t turn anything up. After his inspection, he said that I needed to replace the solenoid, and that I might need to replace the Power Clutch Module, but that he wouldn’t know for sure until after we replaced the solenoid and he could run tests. Apparently, Toyota put out a bulletin that there’s a known problem with the computer, but I haven’t been able to find it. He replaced the solenoid and the transmission filters (he said they were filthy; more on this later.) (~$500)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His tests ran fine, but he said to come back in a few days to see if the Power Clutch Module would need to be replaced. A couple of days later, the check engine light came on again (also while driving at freeway speeds), so I took my car back. He ran tests again, and advised to replace the computer. I had my car back while he ordered the part, and I ended up waiting about a week to bring it back in because of my schedule. He replaced it (~$700), and just a few &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; later, the check engine light came back (again at freeway speeds).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This entire time, I have not noticed anything wrong with my car other than the check engine light. I’ve been watching my dashboard, and my RPMs haven’t seemed high (somewhere between 2 and 3,000 at high speeds). No weird noises, no control issues, no trouble getting to/keeping my speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current plan is to take my car back to the mechanic, but since he already fixed both of the problems that he found, I’m worried that whatever is wrong with my car is going to be this ridiculously difficult to pin-point problem, and I wanted to know if any of you had advice/experience with something similar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Car Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2007 Toyota Corolla LE&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.8L 4CYL DOHC 16V VVT-i SFI Engine&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 Speed ECT Automatic Transmission&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Purchased New, a little over 6 years ago&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;~66,000 miles&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 accident, about two years ago: My ex hit an entire wheel (possibly the spare tire from a truck?

(Thank goodness for insurance.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I take it in for regular service every 5-6,000 miles, all of which except for 2-3 oil changes have been to Toyota, so if they think I put the wrong transmission fluid in, it’s probably something they did. At 15/30/45/60, I took it in for major service, which I would have thought covered at least checking the transmission and telling me I needed to pay X for Y service, but my current mechanic said it looked like the filter had never been replaced (or at least not been replaced in too long.)

Just let me know if there is anything else that is needed to know to help and i can update and respond. And as i said before, i'm out of town and also don't have a reliable source for internet, so it may take a while to respond.\n\n- Thanks ahead of time\n\nSmall edit: My friend checked the alternator, battery, and starter for the voltages. They are all good. It could possibly be just the starter is already bad, but what would cause a starter to go bad within a year?","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f8jkk","clicked":false,"title":"1990 Toyota Corolla 1.6L won't start engaging starter.","media":null,"score":4,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2s47e","edited":1369794171,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":1,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/Cartalk/comments/1f8jkk/1990_toyota_corolla_16l_wont_start_engaging/","name":"t3_1f8jkk","created":1369817048,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1f8jkk/1990_toyota_corolla_16l_wont_start_engaging/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"RavenMac","created_utc":1369788248,"ups":5,"num_comments":6,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.Cartalk","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Cartalk","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I have been working on my 99 cobra mustang swap for quite a while now, and last night I damaged the old starter solenoid when I was trying to adjust the wiring harness.

It was essentially revved in neutral for probably less than a second.\n\nEDIT: I didn't hit the rev limiter","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f62yx","clicked":false,"title":"Went beyond the redline...","media":null,"score":15,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2s47e","edited":1369761112,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":1,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/Cartalk/comments/1f62yx/went_beyond_the_redline/","name":"t3_1f62yx","created":1369729449,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1f62yx/went_beyond_the_redline/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"CarbineGuy","created_utc":1369700649,"ups":16,"num_comments":25,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.Cartalk","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Cartalk","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a run in with a chuck of tire the other day, and it pulled out the part of my bumper that fits against the fender.

I decided to see what would happen if i ran some water through the inlet end of the filter and nothing would come out of the other end so I am assuming that \"the perfect storm\" so to say happened with the crap in my gas where it was just building up at the right time to do this to me.\n\nWill finish the job after lunch and hope that is the cause.","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f2u4w","clicked":false,"title":"OBD1 BMW 325is, died while driving, no start.","media":null,"score":9,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2s47e","edited":1369587997,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":1,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/Cartalk/comments/1f2u4w/obd1_bmw_325is_died_while_driving_no_start/","name":"t3_1f2u4w","created":1369599978,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1f2u4w/obd1_bmw_325is_died_while_driving_no_start/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"blindsk02","created_utc":1369571178,"ups":10,"num_comments":9,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.Cartalk","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Cartalk","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might remember me.

I'm thinking a short somewhere possibly...but what's the best way to diagnose/identify?\n\nTL:DR; Headlight fix didn't work, Fuses are Good, What do to next?\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/oyt4G","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f1s3f","clicked":false,"title":"Not so simple headlight repair; 99 Cadillac Seville STS","media":null,"score":3,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2s47e","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":1,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/Cartalk/comments/1f1s3f/not_so_simple_headlight_repair_99_cadillac/","name":"t3_1f1s3f","created":1369546509,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1f1s3f/not_so_simple_headlight_repair_99_cadillac/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"nodea5","created_utc":1369517709,"ups":4,"num_comments":2,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.Cartalk","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Cartalk","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of the bulb in question.

My radiator fan (pretty sure that's what it is since it's right behind the radiator, but I am car-retarded) seems to be working normally.\n\nNot sure if there's anything else I can tell you.

I bought my car 6 months ago and recently did an oil change at Toyota where they said everything was ok. \n\nSo guys is it the battery or cold weather or I just need to drive more and get it charged?\n\n**Update**: I took my battery out of my car and charged it with a battery charger inside my house for approximately 12 hours after letting it thaw. Installed it back yesterday evening and it started with no issues. Drove around for approximately 1 hour. Parked it outdoors in -30 degree celsius (with wind chill -40) over night and started it today morning again with no issues. \n\nSo I know my battery is 5+ years old now and I should get it changed ASAP but this was a good learning experience for me as I am new to the northern part of Canada. Also some people recommended removing the battery from the car if you know you will not be using your car for 2-3 days in extreme cold conditions.

Heater core should be fine. \n\nThank for any advice!","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"15j5ry","clicked":false,"title":"Heating issue in 2000 Dodge Stratus","media":null,"score":3,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1r","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":4,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/auto/comments/15j5ry/heating_issue_in_2000_dodge_stratus/","name":"t3_15j5ry","created":1356636508,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/auto/comments/15j5ry/heating_issue_in_2000_dodge_stratus/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"epot78","created_utc":1356632908,"ups":7,"num_comments":2,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.auto","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"auto","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a 2001 Ford Focus.

What can I do to be more confident in using the rear brake with my front brake?","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1faqt7","clicked":false,"title":"Regarding using the rear brake...","media":null,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi6d","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":"us","downs":0,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/motorcycles/comments/1faqt7/regarding_using_the_rear_brake/","name":"t3_1faqt7","created":1369895277,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1faqt7/regarding_using_the_rear_brake/","author_flair_text":"'02 Suzuki GSX-R 600 Telefonica Movistar","author":"shiewt","created_utc":1369866477,"ups":1,"num_comments":6,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.motorcycles","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"motorcycles","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone.
