The Oculus is a headset with two screens built in. When playing a game it projects a separate image for each eye. On top of that it has sensors to detect which way you&amp;#39;re facing, so when you look around the game world using the Oculus you literally turn your head.

You know what to expect – you turn around and the world moves with you – still experiencing it in action was enough to put a smile on my face. The level of immersion you feel is amazing. Oftentimes I forgot I was sitting in front of a mouse and keyboard and would bump my head into the computer monitor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of that said, you are tied to a computer, mouse, and keyboard and I think that fact limits the power of the Oculus. In particular I am not in love with the control scheme present in most of the demos. You move with the arrow keys, rotate your body with the mouse, and move your head with the Oculus. It sounds find but in practice I found it unnatural. Wearing the Oculus, I wanted to turn around and head in a new direction – head first, just like if I were walking – but doing so would mean turning away from the keyboard and mouse. Instead I found I often turned my head, then moved the mouse to adjust my in-game body, then turned my head back towards the computer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Picture of me wearing the Oculus&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of all the demos I tried my favorite was the Tuscany one. The ones I downloaded from the developer site either suffered from a very low framerate and lots of pop-ins, or else were difficult to figure out or boring. I&amp;#39;ve also tried Half Life 2 with the Oculus and all-in-all the experience is great. My only complaint is that the control scheme does not take advantage of the Oculus as outlined above. Still that can be forgiven for a game released years before the Oculus even existed! Most of the demos I found involved moving around a world in the first person.

It&amp;#39;s so different and out there that I imagine it won&amp;#39;t appeal to everyone – even among hardcore gamers.

The system is pretty simple and exposed in Lua (start/cancel animations). It can animate various properties and there&amp;#39;s 41 predefined curves. On to the point of the post..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we made a demo to showcase the system and would like to know what you think! These were the goals of the demo:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A tribute to pixels, Nintendo, gamedev, oldschool demos.. things we love from our childhood&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Show what kinds of things you can do with a very simple animation system&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Show that it has good performance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Show that our engine is versatile&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have some kind of character to it, maybe even charming&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hope to drop a few jaws :)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are coders with limited skills of the fine arts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Time. Always time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we decided to pace it like an oldschool demo. Start small and let it gradually build, showing different effects on the pixels along the way. We thought a lot about themes and specifically how we could implement them, given our limited art skills. That&amp;#39;s when we decided to just do animated pixels and see where we could take it. We thought using some well known images would make it more fun to watch, hope the owners don&amp;#39;t mind. The music is stock audio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Implementation:\nThe whole demo is scripted in lua on top of the engine, using 4096 game objects (the pixels, then some for controlling) and &amp;gt;35000 concurrent anim-tracks. The big number is a result from animating each element (x, y, etc) separately for increased control in combination with overlapping animations. We made the img-morphs by simply randomizing a lookup array and animating pos + colour. The image data was converted from png&amp;#39;s into lua tables using a handy program we wrote in Go. The turtle is just a big flipbook-animated sprite with some physics attached to it, while Mario is the real deal throughout. :) We spent somewhere around 30 hrs in total to make it.\nThe anim system itself animates various kinds of numerical properties. They can be game object transforms, custom shader constants or custom lua properties (basically variables). For good performance, the first two kinds are animated straight into memory while the lua properties demand some lookup and are a bit more expensive.

The system is pretty simple and exposed in Lua (start/cancel animations). It can animate various properties and there's 41 predefined curves. On to the point of the post..\n\nSo we made a demo to showcase the system and would like to know what you think! These were the goals of the demo:\n\n* A tribute to pixels, Nintendo, gamedev, oldschool demos.. things we love from our childhood\n* Show what kinds of things you can do with a very simple animation system\n* Show that it has good performance\n* Show that our engine is versatile\n* Have some kind of character to it, maybe even charming\n* Hope to drop a few jaws :)\n\nSome restrictions:\n\n* We are coders with limited skills of the fine arts\n* Time. Always time.\n\nSo we decided to pace it like an oldschool demo. Start small and let it gradually build, showing different effects on the pixels along the way. We thought a lot about themes and specifically how we could implement them, given our limited art skills. That's when we decided to just do animated pixels and see where we could take it. We thought using some well known images would make it more fun to watch, hope the owners don't mind. The music is stock audio.\n\nImplementation:\nThe whole demo is scripted in lua on top of the engine, using 4096 game objects (the pixels, then some for controlling) and &gt;35000 concurrent anim-tracks. The big number is a result from animating each element (x, y, etc) separately for increased control in combination with overlapping animations. We made the img-morphs by simply randomizing a lookup array and animating pos + colour. The image data was converted from png's into lua tables using a handy program we wrote in Go. The turtle is just a big flipbook-animated sprite with some physics attached to it, while Mario is the real deal throughout. :) We spent somewhere around 30 hrs in total to make it.\nThe anim system itself animates various kinds of numerical properties. They can be game object transforms, custom shader constants or custom lua properties (basically variables). For good performance, the first two kinds are animated straight into memory while the lua properties demand some lookup and are a bit more expensive. We use LUTs for the anim-eval curves, also for performance.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThe demo runs at 60 FPS (new MacBook pro), but hitches when the turtle-shell hits Mario. The hitch is a result from enabling all of Marios 4 dynamic objs per pixel and updating the broadphase once per object.. not good. Optimizations are planned and we hope to get it running smoothly at full framerate on decent PC's. We use Box2D for physics and need to fix a few things in there.\n\nSo what do you think? To get you started:\n\n* Overall impression?\n* Did we meet our goals? Why not?\n* Music ok?\n* How can the demo be improved?\n* Be honest pls!\n\nAppreciate the feedback!","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1fao20","clicked":false,"title":"Demo: Using game objects as individual pixels.. crazy?","media":null,"score":3,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi0a","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":"","downs":1,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/gamedev/comments/1fao20/demo_using_game_objects_as_individual_pixels_crazy/","name":"t3_1fao20","created":1369893141,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1fao20/demo_using_game_objects_as_individual_pixels_crazy/","author_flair_text":"@defoldengine","author":"ragnarsvensson","created_utc":1369864341,"ups":4,"num_comments":7,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.gamedev","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"gamedev","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been recently moving my development away from Flash and focusing on C#, and one of the main things I&amp;#39;ve been missing is the ability to tween things easily.

Its multi player (currently 2 or 4 but that's not set in stone), but currently local only.We are in the process of adding network play but I think it will take us at least a month to add it (We are doing this in our spare time).\n\nDo you think its a good idea to release an early version of the game on Ouya that is local multi player only? We would not be charging for anything in the game at this time (no idea what our monetary plan is!).\n\nI guess the question can be asked in more general way too, is it a good idea to release a game that is not feature complete?\n\nThe worry would be that people would write off the game because they can not play it online, and by the time we add network support people will not give it a second look?\nIdeally, the game is best played locally. I feel the chaos and shouting will be lost a little when playing online. But being realistic, a local multiplayer only game has way too narrow of a target audience to be popular (in my opinion). Like I love playing local multiplayer games, but I don't get a chance to often and I'd imagine lots of people are in the same boat\n\nIf anyone has opinions I would love to hear them.","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f9e5h","clicked":false,"title":"Releasing a game that is not feature complete?","media":null,"score":12,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi0a","edited":1369822751,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":4,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/gamedev/comments/1f9e5h/releasing_a_game_that_is_not_feature_complete/","name":"t3_1f9e5h","created":1369851311,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1f9e5h/releasing_a_game_that_is_not_feature_complete/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"witnessmenow","created_utc":1369822511,"ups":16,"num_comments":30,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.gamedev","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"gamedev","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://gamelab.mit.edu/research/openrelativity/\"&gt;http://gamelab.mit.edu/research/openrelativity/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"http://gamelab.mit.edu/research/openrelativity/","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f7y5z","clicked":false,"title":"MIT Game Lab have made their \"A Slower Speed of Light\" into an open-source toolkit so you can build your own relativity games (x-post from /r/programming)","media":null,"score":142,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi0a","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":31,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/gamedev/comments/1f7y5z/mit_game_lab_have_made_their_a_slower_speed_of/","name":"t3_1f7y5z","created":1369800735,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1f7y5z/mit_game_lab_have_made_their_a_slower_speed_of/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"entelechy_","created_utc":1369771935,"ups":173,"num_comments":7,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.gamedev","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"gamedev","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys and girls, so I really want to make a platformer game but I don&amp;#39;t know if I need to know C++ or java or python or something else..

Today, I&amp;#39;m going to explain a little bit more about how this group movement actually works - and also introduce a new monster to the pack: The Skeleton Archer, with its Ranged Attacks. Combine Archers and Skeletons together and you have quite a challenging group of foes to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ Group Chasing Behaviours in Detail ]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s break this group chasing behaviour down:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 . &lt;strong&gt;Detection Phase&lt;/strong&gt;. For each frame (more specifically each iteration of the Behaviour Tree), the monster maintains 2 lists: threats (you), and friendlies (other skeletons) - based on line of sight. Entities that cannot be seen are not included in this list. The lists are cleared at the beginning of each iteration. In addition to these, breadcrumbs dropped by both threats and friendlies are also recorded. In future versions, things like visible furniture, entrances and exit doors, walls etc... will also be added. By this point, the monster now has a reasonable view of the world on this exact frame, and we use this information to help the AI determine what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 . &lt;strong&gt;Intention Phase&lt;/strong&gt;. This is where the Behaviour Tree comes in handy - to aid in the decision making process. We&amp;#39;ll not cover the specifics of the Behaviour Tree implementation here - the details are too numerous and will best fit in a future post. For an overview of Behaviour Trees, AIGameDev covers this particularly well: &lt;a href=\"http://aigamedev.com/open/article/bt-overview/\"&gt;http://aigamedev.com/open/article/bt-overview/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, conceptually speaking, our tree models a list of ordered priorities: A. Deal with threats, B. Follow alerted friendlies, C. Patrol. The first one we&amp;#39;ve already covered in Part 1: monsters chase after players in their line of sight, then breadcrumbs (smell trail), then to the target&amp;#39;s last recorded location. If these actions fail - the next branch (priority) of the tree is parsed and the monster has a look at what the friendlies are up to. If his friends are alerted, this state is passed on and the monster becomes alerted also. He then proceeds to follow the alerted friend in the same way as in priority A (again line of sight, breadcrumbs, and last recorded location). If this fails also (there are no &lt;strong&gt;alerted&lt;/strong&gt; friends visible), then we fall back to patrol (with best guess).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priority B is particularly important - it allows the monsters to follow each other in a chain/queue-like fashion. As long as the leader of the pack is alerted and can see the enemy, this state and behaviour is propagated to other mobs down in the chain. There&amp;#39;s some bugs and caveats to this method, one of them is that it&amp;#39;s easy for the monsters to chase each other in a loop (or pairs), so there&amp;#39;s some failsafe hackery code to stop this from happening. This is WIP, we plan on cleaning up this behaviour during production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 . &lt;strong&gt;Movement Phase&lt;/strong&gt;. Simply apply the intentions above to actual movement (modify velocities, update positions, repel from walls, separate from nearby entities etc..)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ Skeleton Archers and Ranged Attacks in Detail ]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where the Behaviour Trees really shine. Because we&amp;#39;ve already defined a lot of the basic maneuvers described in Part 1, 2 &amp;amp; 3 as &lt;strong&gt;behaviour nodes&lt;/strong&gt; we can now mix and match them to create new behaviours in our tree. A good example, is the Skeleton Archer. In our tree, there is a conditional node that switches between Chasing Behaviours (from Part 1) and Retreating Behaviours (Part 2). The condition is a whether the distance from the monster to the player is above or below 2 thresholds. To illustrate, we might have an Archer chase the player if it is 100 units away, but flee from the player if it is less than 50. The gap between the 50 and 100 threshold is to ensure we don&amp;#39;t rubber band between the two states too quickly, so if the distance is 75 units, we remain in the current state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the resulting behaviour is that the Archer maintains a nice position away from you: never to engage in melee combat but always close enough to use his bow and arrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ Conclusion ]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from the new Archer behaviours, there&amp;#39;s no special code to formulate groups here. It just so happens that a combination of melee type Skeletons (who are extremely aggressive and will chase you down as much as possible) and ranged Archers (who are cautious and will try to maintain a certain distance from you) results in quite effective emergent behaviour - it almost looks like they are working together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ More Ideas for Group AI ]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The above shows very basic, fundamental rules for group interaction. It&amp;#39;s a work in progress - but we plan on bringing more complex manoeuvres in regards to group tactics. Depending on the monster type, critters will be able to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Monsters won&amp;#39;t attack if they are alone, and will flee instead. Some intelligent ones will flee towards a known group of other monsters. This results in luring, pulling the character towards a more dangerous area and then attacking again.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wounded skeletons prefer to escape while their friends are locked in battle - to go and find corpses, heal, and return to the fray later.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leaders - if a Skeleton King is in the area, his minions will tend to follow and do what he does.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flanking - if the player is currently engaged in battle, other monsters will attempt to flank you from either side or behind.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ A plea for help for the next two days ]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As some of you may already know - my game TinyKeep is on Kickstarter and there are currently only 2 days left of funding to go! If you enjoy reading these kinds of technical articles, please consider pledging so I can continue active development of the game. Currently I have accrued over half the amount I need (~70%), but as Kickstarter is all or nothing I need to make the full £22k or I lose all my pledges so far. If I get funded, I plan to keep on releasing articles on all aspects of the game&amp;#39;s development, including AI but also game mechanics, procedural generation, multiplayer networking, 3D graphics &amp;amp; animation, performance optimization, workflow, physics, collision detection - and everything in between!

Entities that cannot be seen are not included in this list. The lists are cleared at the beginning of each iteration. In addition to these, breadcrumbs dropped by both threats and friendlies are also recorded. In future versions, things like visible furniture, entrances and exit doors, walls etc... will also be added. By this point, the monster now has a reasonable view of the world on this exact frame, and we use this information to help the AI determine what to do next.\n\n2 . **Intention Phase**. This is where the Behaviour Tree comes in handy - to aid in the decision making process. We'll not cover the specifics of the Behaviour Tree implementation here - the details are too numerous and will best fit in a future post. For an overview of Behaviour Trees, AIGameDev covers this particularly well: http://aigamedev.com/open/article/bt-overview/\n\nSo, conceptually speaking, our tree models a list of ordered priorities: A. Deal with threats, B. Follow alerted friendlies, C. Patrol. The first one we've already covered in Part 1: monsters chase after players in their line of sight, then breadcrumbs (smell trail), then to the target's last recorded location. If these actions fail - the next branch (priority) of the tree is parsed and the monster has a look at what the friendlies are up to. If his friends are alerted, this state is passed on and the monster becomes alerted also. He then proceeds to follow the alerted friend in the same way as in priority A (again line of sight, breadcrumbs, and last recorded location). If this fails also (there are no **alerted** friends visible), then we fall back to patrol (with best guess).\n\nPriority B is particularly important - it allows the monsters to follow each other in a chain/queue-like fashion. As long as the leader of the pack is alerted and can see the enemy, this state and behaviour is propagated to other mobs down in the chain. There's some bugs and caveats to this method, one of them is that it's easy for the monsters to chase each other in a loop (or pairs), so there's some failsafe hackery code to stop this from happening. This is WIP, we plan on cleaning up this behaviour during production.\n\n3 . **Movement Phase**. Simply apply the intentions above to actual movement (modify velocities, update positions, repel from walls, separate from nearby entities etc..)\n\n**[ Skeleton Archers and Ranged Attacks in Detail ]**\n\nThis is where the Behaviour Trees really shine. Because we've already defined a lot of the basic maneuvers described in Part 1, 2 &amp; 3 as **behaviour nodes** we can now mix and match them to create new behaviours in our tree. A good example, is the Skeleton Archer. In our tree, there is a conditional node that switches between Chasing Behaviours (from Part 1) and Retreating Behaviours (Part 2). The condition is a whether the distance from the monster to the player is above or below 2 thresholds. To illustrate, we might have an Archer chase the player if it is 100 units away, but flee from the player if it is less than 50. The gap between the 50 and 100 threshold is to ensure we don't rubber band between the two states too quickly, so if the distance is 75 units, we remain in the current state.\n\nSo the resulting behaviour is that the Archer maintains a nice position away from you: never to engage in melee combat but always close enough to use his bow and arrow.\n\n**[ Conclusion ]**\n\nApart from the new Archer behaviours, there's no special code to formulate groups here. It just so happens that a combination of melee type Skeletons (who are extremely aggressive and will chase you down as much as possible) and ranged Archers (who are cautious and will try to maintain a certain distance from you) results in quite effective emergent behaviour - it almost looks like they are working together.\n\n**[ More Ideas for Group AI ]**\n\nThe above shows very basic, fundamental rules for group interaction. It's a work in progress - but we plan on bringing more complex manoeuvres in regards to group tactics. Depending on the monster type, critters will be able to do the following:\n\n- Monsters won't attack if they are alone, and will flee instead. Some intelligent ones will flee towards a known group of other monsters. This results in luring, pulling the character towards a more dangerous area and then attacking again.\n- Wounded skeletons prefer to escape while their friends are locked in battle - to go and find corpses, heal, and return to the fray later.\n- Leaders - if a Skeleton King is in the area, his minions will tend to follow and do what he does.\n- Flanking - if the player is currently engaged in battle, other monsters will attempt to flank you from either side or behind.\n\n**[ A plea for help for the next two days ]**\n\nAs some of you may already know - my game TinyKeep is on Kickstarter and there are currently only 2 days left of funding to go! If you enjoy reading these kinds of technical articles, please consider pledging so I can continue active development of the game. Currently I have accrued over half the amount I need (~70%), but as Kickstarter is all or nothing I need to make the full £22k or I lose all my pledges so far. If I get funded, I plan to keep on releasing articles on all aspects of the game's development, including AI but also game mechanics, procedural generation, multiplayer networking, 3D graphics &amp; animation, performance optimization, workflow, physics, collision detection - and everything in between! I don't claim to be an expert on all of these subejcts - this is just my journey in the world of game development, but I hope beginners out there will find inspiration from this. So please help if you can!\n\n**Have a look at our project for more information:**\n\n[TinyKeep - A 3D Multiplayer Dungeon Crawler for Windows/Mac](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phidinh/tinykeep)","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f6x25","clicked":false,"title":"Monster AI System for TinyKeep Explained (Part 4 of 5)","media":null,"score":56,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi0a","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":16,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/gamedev/comments/1f6x25/monster_ai_system_for_tinykeep_explained_part_4/","name":"t3_1f6x25","created":1369765346,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1f6x25/monster_ai_system_for_tinykeep_explained_part_4/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"phidinh6","created_utc":1369736546,"ups":72,"num_comments":26,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.gamedev","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"gamedev","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know there are games like &lt;a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/codespells/\"&gt;codespells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.alice.org\"&gt;alice&lt;/a&gt; that help kids and beginners learn how to program. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wondering if any redditor knows other games that teaches users how to programming? ty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"I know there are games like [codespells](https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/codespells/) and [alice](http://www.alice.org) that help kids and beginners learn how to program. \n\nWondering if any redditor knows other games that teaches users how to programming? ty.\n","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f7mpt","clicked":false,"title":"Are there any games that teaches you how to program?","media":null,"score":5,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi0a","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":7,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/gamedev/comments/1f7mpt/are_there_any_games_that_teaches_you_how_to/","name":"t3_1f7mpt","created":1369792294,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1f7mpt/are_there_any_games_that_teaches_you_how_to/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Maxkeo","created_utc":1369763494,"ups":12,"num_comments":18,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.gamedev","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"gamedev","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am currently in contact with the EFF about the registered &amp;quot;Tower Defense&amp;quot; trademark owned by Com2Us.

If you do feel like seeing it first hand, here is the game, code and some information about the breeding system and such (I didn't want to just include a link to the game since I could've just done that for Feedback Friday, so thought some of these other posts about breeding, server setup, etc may interest someone) \n\n* [Game](http://liza.io/gameofsnails)\n* [Post with release disclaimers](http://liza.io/game-of-snails-in-all-its-barely-playable-glory/)\n* [Code]( https://github.com/drakonka/A-Game-of-Snails)\n* [Breeding system/genetics](http://liza.io/a-game-of-snails-breeding-system/)\n* [Server setup](http://liza.io/a-game-of-snails-and-heroku/)\n* [Rough feature list](http://liza.io/a-game-of-snails-feature-list/)\n\nThanks in advance for any advice/thoughts","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f4rn1","clicked":false,"title":"Trying to make a list of priorities - what level of polish to achieve before looking for collaborators?","media":null,"score":13,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi0a","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":"","downs":3,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/gamedev/comments/1f4rn1/trying_to_make_a_list_of_priorities_what_level_of/","name":"t3_1f4rn1","created":1369681655,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1f4rn1/trying_to_make_a_list_of_priorities_what_level_of/","author_flair_text":"@Lazer","author":"drakonka","created_utc":1369652855,"ups":16,"num_comments":13,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.gamedev","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"gamedev","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few folks in our team, namely Xoppa, Bach and I, have been working on this for a while now (mostly Xoppa, all praise be Xoppa).

My other concern is that I have multiple kinds of monsters and don't know how to clarify to the game which one the player is currently fighting. I have several responses that tell the player what they're fighting but if the game doesn't know it doesn't much matter.(Beyond this point the bolded print is my notes on the code and unbolded print is the code. \n\n(AOL unindented the code I apologize in advance.)\n#Code for combat\n def combat():\n comchoice = raw_input(\"Will you swing your Longsword or use Star Slice?\")\n if comchoice == \"Longsword\":\n                                              &lt;---on this line I plan to tell the game to subtract however much damage the player did from the monsters health\n if comchoice == \"Trinomy\":\n                                             &lt;---on this line I plan to tell the game to subtract however much damage the player did from the monsters health \n\nI have a class for the monsters and several kinds of them\n#Defining different kinds of monsters\n Orc = Monster(\"Orc Marauder\", 50, 300)\n Kobold = Monster(\"Kobold Rogue\", 25, 150)\n Goblin = Monster(\"Goblin Runt\", 10, 100)\n Fairy = Monster(\"Cursed Fairy Queen\", 0, 666)\n Dragon = Monster(\"Dragon Lord\", 999, 500)\n\nThe player chooses from three different paths and gets a randomly generated response from one of these.\n#Coding the progression of the adventure\n Response1 = \"You continue forward until you reach another three way split. Which do you take?\"\n Response2 = \"You have encountered a psychotic Goblin Runt! Prepare for battle!\"\n Response3 = \"You have encountered a vicious Kobold Rogue! Prepare for battle!\"\n Response4 = \"You have encountered a mighty Orc Marauder! Prepare for battle!\"\n Response5 = \"You have come across a beautiful maiden with black wings. What will you do?\"\n Response6 = \"You have reached the goal of your journey! Before you stands the Dragon Lord! Gather all your might brave hero!\"\n Response7 = \"You have fled from battle. You rest and recover your HP!\"\n\n\nI believe I have all the pieces here to make this work properly. But I'm just not sure how to connect them all. The idea of making different \"Combat\" functions for each monster and attaching them to the responses ran through my head but I feel their should be a much simpler method. I'm also pretty sure just telling it \"Monster.health = Monster.health - AtkDamage\" wouldn't work because I need to specify that I'm talking about either the Orc, Kobold, Goblin etc. \n\nThank you in advance for any assistance you can give me. I'll send you the whole code in a separate email just in case you need it for reference.","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f2j8o","clicked":false,"title":"Question About Combat Code(Coding in Python)","media":null,"score":0,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi0a","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":8,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/gamedev/comments/1f2j8o/question_about_combat_codecoding_in_python/","name":"t3_1f2j8o","created":1369576617,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1f2j8o/question_about_combat_codecoding_in_python/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"apersona","created_utc":1369547817,"ups":7,"num_comments":2,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.gamedev","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"gamedev","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of some sort of user login system? \nInterested in your feed back :)\nThanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"I was thinking of some sort of user login system? \nInterested in your feed back :)\nThanks!","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f1v1r","clicked":false,"title":"[Question] How would you get around piracy when selling your game?","media":null,"score":3,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi0a","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":9,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/gamedev/comments/1f1v1r/question_how_would_you_get_around_piracy_when/","name":"t3_1f1v1r","created":1369549428,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1f1v1r/question_how_would_you_get_around_piracy_when/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Jamtheman1017","created_utc":1369520628,"ups":12,"num_comments":28,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.gamedev","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"gamedev","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My class are a strong group of enthusiastic, university level, grade 11 students who have just finished learning the basics of object oriented programming and are about to engage in their final project - to create a Greenfoot game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Greenfoot is an education-oriented combination of a BlueJ-like IDE and a 2d graphics and object management engine).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every year, I add new lessons to their Greenfoot unit to give them as many tools (animation, sound, data management, mouse use, program flow) to make the best games possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This year I thought I&amp;#39;d ask the pros:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you could give one tip to a budding, interested computer game programmer, what would it be?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"My class are a strong group of enthusiastic, university level, grade 11 students who have just finished learning the basics of object oriented programming and are about to engage in their final project - to create a Greenfoot game.\n\n(Greenfoot is an education-oriented combination of a BlueJ-like IDE and a 2d graphics and object management engine).\n\nEvery year, I add new lessons to their Greenfoot unit to give them as many tools (animation, sound, data management, mouse use, program flow) to make the best games possible.\n\nThis year I thought I'd ask the pros:\n\nIf you could give one tip to a budding, interested computer game programmer, what would it be?","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f1ckn","clicked":false,"title":"I'm a high school computer programming teacher giving out the final assignment - writing a game.
