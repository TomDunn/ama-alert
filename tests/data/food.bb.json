Scaling up from cooking scallops for 2 to scallops for 6 was a bit of a challenge, but overall, things went better than anticipated.","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1eujm6","clicked":false,"title":"Scallops","media":null,"score":3,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh7f","edited":1369774949,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":1,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/Cooking/comments/1eujm6/scallops/","name":"t3_1eujm6","created":1369274854,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1eujm6/scallops/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"TinHao","created_utc":1369246054,"ups":4,"num_comments":11,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.Cooking","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"Cooking","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will be in a hotel for 3 wks and want to avoid eating out every night.

The third time I did pulled pork, and stopped a bit earlier than the recipe recommended, so things went ok. In short, the crock pot seems to be above average hot, even if I fill it about 2/3 to the top.\n\nNow, I've seen lots of delicious looking dessert recipes, such as apple oatmeal dessert, granola bars, etc, but the recipes mostly seem to be fit for smaller cookers. I'd like to hear about your experiences with such recipes. Did you multiply the amount and end up with a weeks worth of desserts? Did you simply cook it for less time? Or did you find a recipe that works irregardless of pot size?

I really hope you enjoy this as much as I do.\n\nEdit - Reference to tomato sauce changed to be more inclusive of other countries - I am Australian\n","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f8eao","clicked":false,"title":"Devil Sauce a.k.a Ambrosia a.k.a The last sauce you will ever use.","media":null,"score":208,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh56","edited":1369799159,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":56,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/recipes/comments/1f8eao/devil_sauce_aka_ambrosia_aka_the_last_sauce_you/","name":"t3_1f8eao","created":1369812946,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1f8eao/devil_sauce_aka_ambrosia_aka_the_last_sauce_you/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"MOISTY_OYSTER","created_utc":1369784146,"ups":264,"num_comments":49,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"reddit.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"recipes","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f7qp3","clicked":false,"title":"greetings /r/Recipes, we over at /r/Scotch are discussing cooking meat with Whisky today, would you like to add some recipes to our thread please?","media":null,"score":70,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh56","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":13,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/recipes/comments/1f7qp3/greetings_rrecipes_we_over_at_rscotch_are/","name":"t3_1f7qp3","created":1369795283,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1f79nj/laphroaig_ribs_update_sorry_vegetarians/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"texacer","created_utc":1369766483,"ups":83,"num_comments":4,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"churrosnchai.wordpress.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"recipes","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f7nm9","clicked":false,"title":"Chocolate Chip Cookie Cake","media":null,"score":49,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh56","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":17,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/recipes/comments/1f7nm9/chocolate_chip_cookie_cake/","name":"t3_1f7nm9","created":1369793017,"url":"http://churrosnchai.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/recipe-chocolate-chip-cookie-cake/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Angelaconnors","created_utc":1369764217,"ups":66,"num_comments":4,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"easyasbananas.blogspot.fr","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"recipes","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f718g","clicked":false,"title":"A picture-by-picture recipe for making pizza dough;

We can store food for a few days in a cooler, but bulky items and sauces are in short supply. \n\nThere is a vegetarian with us, so if anything where meat's not the main ingredient would be awesome (like I could sub it out for something). \n\nThank you in advance!","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1esmpg","clicked":false,"title":"Stove-top only recipe [request]","media":null,"score":6,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh56","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":1,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/recipes/comments/1esmpg/stovetop_only_recipe_request/","name":"t3_1esmpg","created":1369204714,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1esmpg/stovetop_only_recipe_request/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Pneumatocyst","created_utc":1369175914,"ups":7,"num_comments":2,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"oneworldplate.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"recipes","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1era4w","clicked":false,"title":"Edamame Summer Rolls","media":null,"score":24,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh56","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":11,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/recipes/comments/1era4w/edamame_summer_rolls/","name":"t3_1era4w","created":1369163354,"url":"http://oneworldplate.com/2013/05/21/edamame-summer-rolls/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"JJ_Balla","created_utc":1369134554,"ups":35,"num_comments":3,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"imgur.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"recipes","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1epfju","clicked":false,"title":"Deep Fried Pizza Donuts","media":null,"score":277,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh56","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":120,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/recipes/comments/1epfju/deep_fried_pizza_donuts/","name":"t3_1epfju","created":1369100738,"url":"http://imgur.com/QyIYrc5","author_flair_text":null,"author":"readcommentbackwards","created_utc":1369071938,"ups":397,"num_comments":38,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"canadianbudgetbinder.com","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"recipes","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1ery4z","clicked":false,"title":"Mr.CBB’s Carbonara with Sausage and Cheese Polenta Bake","media":null,"score":3,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh56","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":2,"saved":false,"is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/recipes/comments/1ery4z/mrcbbs_carbonara_with_sausage_and_cheese_polenta/","name":"t3_1ery4z","created":1369186853,"url":"http://canadianbudgetbinder.com/2012/05/20/mr-cbbs-carbonara-with-sausage-and-cheese-polenta-bake-12-75/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"canadianbudgetbinder","created_utc":1369158053,"ups":5,"num_comments":0,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.recipes","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"recipes","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooking dinner for a friend with super-restrictive diet this weekend.

Chop the onion and saute it in the oil in a saucepan for about 3 minutes. Skin and chop the tomato. Slice the mushrooms. Add them to the pan and cook for a further 3 minutes or so. Add the rice and chestnuts to the pan and stir well. Then add the water, yeast extract and tomato paste. Mix together very thoroughly as it heats up so that the yeast extract is amalgamated evenly into the mixture.
