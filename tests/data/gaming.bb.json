As Blizzard typically creates their own engine for their games, we can assume they have a team responsible for that as part of their pre-production crew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if Blizzard is cutting back the Titan team to their pre-production crew, what the hell does that mean for the game?  I thought of:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wanted to do something that the engine couldn&amp;#39;t support, so they&amp;#39;re revamping the engine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They trashed/majorly overhauled the new IP for Titan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts aren&amp;#39;t about Titan itself, but about getting key assets onto other projects. (Could this mean assets are being thrown at Legacy of the Void to make the conclusion of SCII phenomenal?  Is Blizzard about to launch a campaign to push WoW back to it&amp;#39;s peaks?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s hard to see what prompted these changes, with rumours flying about teaser information being released at Blizzcon this year, the Titan team would be taking a good look at their progress thus far to figure out what they were going to present.  Is there still potential for a teaser presentation at Blizzcon?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How is this going to impact Blizzard&amp;#39;s market share?  There&amp;#39;s clearly a lot of work done that&amp;#39;s being thrown out or not used, and with Blizzard&amp;#39;s development team being composed of some of the most experienced developers around, that work doesn&amp;#39;t come cheap.  With Bethesda set to show off the Elder Scrolls MMO at E3, it&amp;#39;s not a good time for Blizzard to be showing weakness or indecisiveness in their development process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What other impacts could this have on Next-gen MMOs?  Are their developers sitting on their hands waiting for more information on Titan before constructing their game?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally I was extremely excited to get some real information on Titan sometime in the next six months.

I thought of:\n\n- They wanted to do something that the engine couldn't support, so they're revamping the engine\n\n- They trashed/majorly overhauled the new IP for Titan.\n\n- The cuts aren't about Titan itself, but about getting key assets onto other projects. (Could this mean assets are being thrown at Legacy of the Void to make the conclusion of SCII phenomenal?  Is Blizzard about to launch a campaign to push WoW back to it's peaks?)\n\n\nI don't think it's hard to see what prompted these changes, with rumours flying about teaser information being released at Blizzcon this year, the Titan team would be taking a good look at their progress thus far to figure out what they were going to present.  Is there still potential for a teaser presentation at Blizzcon?\n\nHow is this going to impact Blizzard's market share?  There's clearly a lot of work done that's being thrown out or not used, and with Blizzard's development team being composed of some of the most experienced developers around, that work doesn't come cheap.  With Bethesda set to show off the Elder Scrolls MMO at E3, it's not a good time for Blizzard to be showing weakness or indecisiveness in their development process.\n\nWhat other impacts could this have on Next-gen MMOs?  Are their developers sitting on their hands waiting for more information on Titan before constructing their game?  \n\nPersonally I was extremely excited to get some real information on Titan sometime in the next six months.  With this news it doesn't sound like that's a realistic expectation.\n\n\n\n\n\n","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1f95dt","clicked":false,"title":"Next Gen MMO Hits Hurdle - Blizzard Hits Reboot on Titan, Rumours Suggest 2016 Release.","media":null,"score":38,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2sgq6","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":20,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/truegaming/comments/1f95dt/next_gen_mmo_hits_hurdle_blizzard_hits_reboot_on/","name":"t3_1f95dt","created":1369836311,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1f95dt/next_gen_mmo_hits_hurdle_blizzard_hits_reboot_on/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Alame","created_utc":1369807511,"ups":58,"num_comments":41,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.truegaming","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"truegaming","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open world, fight for survival, ability to set up base camps, scavenging for supplies, limited resources &amp;amp; permanent death.

A bonded Pokemon receives stat bonuses, based on the level of the bond. Additionally, a bonded Pokemon gains a &amp;quot;Bond Ability&amp;quot; unique to that Pokemon that affects the entire Pokemon party, and this ability improves as the bond tier improves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reason: An effective strategy will now incorporated how Pokemon will synergize with a bond ability.

In addition to being a non-intuitive and very transparent game mechanic, it frustratingly difficult to control even if you know it exists.

I wonder how MS will fare in other waters given that many of the features advertised are not easily put into other places. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the factor of voice recognition. Is it good enough to work in Chinese, Japanese, French, German, Spanish, Italian and all these other languages? How can MS cater to the &amp;quot;entertainment needs&amp;quot; of a household with their integrated set top box etc. when most consumers in Europe don&amp;#39;t even have that kind of thing? Many have either cut the cords or use boxes provided by their providers, usually cable goes right into the TVs and Pay TV is barely mainstream in some places. There seems to be nothing to replace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously the NFL deal will create little to no interest in Europe so will they get different deals for every country? Football leagues for most of Europe, Cricket for Britain and India, the list could go on and on. This will require a massive amount of micromanagement and then you&amp;#39;ve only covered sports.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about content streaming, specifically Netflix deals and similiar offers when &amp;quot;Netflix is not available in your country&amp;quot;? There are massive limitations in some countries for licensing as well as traffic limits, will MS just pay off the internet providers or will they rely on the streaming services to sort this out?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally I fear they are making themselves obsolete at some point by competing with the &amp;quot;integrated media market&amp;quot;. Ultimately TVs, the most essential things that provide the needed screens can integrate most of the non-gaming uses at a pretty low price due to simply having less space constraints and shorter iteration cycles. I don&amp;#39;t know whether they can promote their idea quickly enough in so many different places before adaption rates fall due to TV innovations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has the potential to become either great or a truly massive clusterfuck. I know that for example Japan was never a focus market for the Xbox brand but can they afford to mess up even once on an international level with this generation? Not to mention the different perception of the whole Kinect always-on between cultures. I foresee great troubles for MS with this generation.

The last time MS wanted to &amp;quot;integrate everything&amp;quot; they alienated core users with what we call Windows 8 and it was not their finest hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"I just got done reading [this](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-05-21-xbox-one-microsoft-biting-off-more-than-it-can-chew) article and specifically the **comment section**.\n\nIt's true that all we've seen today catered towards the US market. I wonder how MS will fare in other waters given that many of the features advertised are not easily put into other places. \n\nThere's the factor of voice recognition. Is it good enough to work in Chinese, Japanese, French, German, Spanish, Italian and all these other languages? How can MS cater to the \"entertainment needs\" of a household with their integrated set top box etc. when most consumers in Europe don't even have that kind of thing? Many have either cut the cords or use boxes provided by their providers, usually cable goes right into the TVs and Pay TV is barely mainstream in some places. There seems to be nothing to replace.\n\nObviously the NFL deal will create little to no interest in Europe so will they get different deals for every country? Football leagues for most of Europe, Cricket for Britain and India, the list could go on and on. This will require a massive amount of micromanagement and then you've only covered sports.\n\nWhat about content streaming, specifically Netflix deals and similiar offers when \"Netflix is not available in your country\"? There are massive limitations in some countries for licensing as well as traffic limits, will MS just pay off the internet providers or will they rely on the streaming services to sort this out?\n\nFinally I fear they are making themselves obsolete at some point by competing with the \"integrated media market\". Ultimately TVs, the most essential things that provide the needed screens can integrate most of the non-gaming uses at a pretty low price due to simply having less space constraints and shorter iteration cycles. I don't know whether they can promote their idea quickly enough in so many different places before adaption rates fall due to TV innovations.\n\nThis has the potential to become either great or a truly massive clusterfuck. I know that for example Japan was never a focus market for the Xbox brand but can they afford to mess up even once on an international level with this generation?

At a first glance, this seems incredibly straightforward; give players the chance to work together to achieve a common goal, making it harder to compensate for the ability of two human players or comparatively easier to get through an area intended only for a single player. However, when there are multiple ways to accomplish that shared objective and player skill can vary widely, things tend to become problematic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take Dead Space 3, for example – I&amp;#39;ve played through the game a few times, to such an extent that I have a few obscenely powerful weapons that make short work of almost any enemy. When I played through the game on co-op with my brother, he was unused to the nuances of player movement and had no idea where any enemy encounters were likely to happen, on top of having comparatively weak weapons. What this resulted in was him triggering encounters while I dealt with the enemies that appeared, only rarely needing him to help with any particular fight until much later in the game. Mercifully, he and I were sitting in the same room and have known each other our entire lives, so communication and criticism was no issue for us. Playing online, however, is often a different story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I own an Xbox 360, and as such need to subscribe to Xbox Live to play anything online. Years of owning Call of Duty has conditioned me to not use my mic unless I really need to or the other person initiates conversation, which leads to interesting problems and solutions in trying to communicate with my co-op partners in other games. In Dead Space 3, the few times I played with random players were generally short affairs in which we were able to get the gist of whatever needed to be conveyed through crouching near objects or pointing our weapons at them. In Resident Evil 5, playing online has tended to match me with players who operate with an absolutely ruthless efficiency that don&amp;#39;t communicate in any meaningful way beyond running to objects that require both of us to manipulate and occasionally healing me, putting me solidly on the low end of the skill spectrum in our partnership (though I&amp;#39;m certainly no slouch when it comes to Resident Evil 5). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My most recent co-op experience, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker HD, has given me a lot to think about in the context of co-op. The overwhelming majority of missions in the game can be attempted with at least one other person, with bosses and longer missions allowing up to four players at once. While missions are generally best done in a stealthy manner and the AI bosses are best handled wearing full combat regalia, those don&amp;#39;t require a particularly deep strategy or result in a disparity in equipment. Where that tends to happen, however, are vehicle missions. For those of you who don&amp;#39;t know, vehicles (helicopters, tanks, various armored attack vehicles) in Peace Walker can be dealt with in two ways: by outright destroying them, or by slowly and stealthily removing their escorting soldiers from the area and then tranquilizing the vehicle&amp;#39;s pilot/driver. Unfortunately, players can&amp;#39;t view what equipment their partners are wearing or using until the mission starts, which has left me as the odd man out in stealth attire, whereas my teammates are dressed to the nines in armor and toting rocket launchers. This also becomes a problem in that there are several weapons and pieces of equipment that only work when used cooperatively, and if you can&amp;#39;t establish communication with your partners you have no way of knowing if they have the supporting components of weapons like the Rail Gun or if they&amp;#39;re even willing to use them.

How can their success be used to craft new experiences across different games or even genres?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"While most games these days focus on competitive multiplayer modes that pit players against one another, co-op multiplayer has seen use in several popular franchises (Resident Evil 5 &amp; 6, Journey, Dead Space 3, etc.). At a first glance, this seems incredibly straightforward; give players the chance to work together to achieve a common goal, making it harder to compensate for the ability of two human players or comparatively easier to get through an area intended only for a single player. However, when there are multiple ways to accomplish that shared objective and player skill can vary widely, things tend to become problematic. \n\nTake Dead Space 3, for example – I've played through the game a few times, to such an extent that I have a few obscenely powerful weapons that make short work of almost any enemy. When I played through the game on co-op with my brother, he was unused to the nuances of player movement and had no idea where any enemy encounters were likely to happen, on top of having comparatively weak weapons. What this resulted in was him triggering encounters while I dealt with the enemies that appeared, only rarely needing him to help with any particular fight until much later in the game. Mercifully, he and I were sitting in the same room and have known each other our entire lives, so communication and criticism was no issue for us. Playing online, however, is often a different story.\n\nI own an Xbox 360, and as such need to subscribe to Xbox Live to play anything online. Years of owning Call of Duty has conditioned me to not use my mic unless I really need to or the other person initiates conversation, which leads to interesting problems and solutions in trying to communicate with my co-op partners in other games. In Dead Space 3, the few times I played with random players were generally short affairs in which we were able to get the gist of whatever needed to be conveyed through crouching near objects or pointing our weapons at them. In Resident Evil 5, playing online has tended to match me with players who operate with an absolutely ruthless efficiency that don't communicate in any meaningful way beyond running to objects that require both of us to manipulate and occasionally healing me, putting me solidly on the low end of the skill spectrum in our partnership (though I'm certainly no slouch when it comes to Resident Evil 5). \n\nMy most recent co-op experience, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker HD, has given me a lot to think about in the context of co-op. The overwhelming majority of missions in the game can be attempted with at least one other person, with bosses and longer missions allowing up to four players at once. While missions are generally best done in a stealthy manner and the AI bosses are best handled wearing full combat regalia, those don't require a particularly deep strategy or result in a disparity in equipment. Where that tends to happen, however, are vehicle missions. For those of you who don't know, vehicles (helicopters, tanks, various armored attack vehicles) in Peace Walker can be dealt with in two ways: by outright destroying them, or by slowly and stealthily removing their escorting soldiers from the area and then tranquilizing the vehicle's pilot/driver. Unfortunately, players can't view what equipment their partners are wearing or using until the mission starts, which has left me as the odd man out in stealth attire, whereas my teammates are dressed to the nines in armor and toting rocket launchers. This also becomes a problem in that there are several weapons and pieces of equipment that only work when used cooperatively, and if you can't establish communication with your partners you have no way of knowing if they have the supporting components of weapons like the Rail Gun or if they're even willing to use them. In-mission communication is far easier, though, since Peace Walker has a built-in system through which players can quickly shuffle through pre-selected messages, making it possible to tell teammates what you're doing.\n\nHere are my questions surrounding co-op play for this subreddit:\n\n* How do you manage communication with strangers versus friends? With or without a microphone?\n* In the event of a particular obstacle or weapon requiring asymmetric teamwork to utilize or overcome (e.g. only one player can be thrown across a gap, one person needs to feed ammo to a turret for the other to fire it, etc.), how do you decide roles?\n* Is there any way to resolve the skill gap between seasoned veterans and unskilled players in a co-op atmosphere that respects the skill of the more experienced player, but still makes the less experienced individual feel useful?\n* What games have the best co-op modes, and what makes them successful? How can their success be used to craft new experiences across different games or even genres?","likes":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1ei6qh","clicked":false,"title":"Co-op: Communication, skill, and how players can work together","media":null,"score":29,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2sgq6","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":22,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/truegaming/comments/1ei6qh/coop_communication_skill_and_how_players_can_work/","name":"t3_1ei6qh","created":1368802523,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1ei6qh/coop_communication_skill_and_how_players_can_work/","author_flair_text":null,"author":"NimhVahReaux","created_utc":1368773723,"ups":51,"num_comments":22,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},{"domain":"self.truegaming","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"truegaming","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been playing games like Call of Duty on consoles for a while, but recently I upgraded my PC&amp;#39;s hardware, so I got into PC games.

A rule in English writing is to avoid the passive verb &amp;quot;to be&amp;quot;; opt instead for more active verbs. &amp;quot;X is a good game&amp;quot; makes for a poor comment. &amp;quot;X shows how it&amp;#39;s possible to give the player unlimited power while also creating challenges to surpass&amp;quot; is specific, and you can build off of it with more examples from the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be polite, and don&amp;#39;t get into flame wars. They annoy me and I have no problem deleting every one I see. Debate is encouraged; name calling is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Surveys&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, we&amp;#39;ve been flooded in modmail with requests for posting surveys for undergraduate research projects. They&amp;#39;ve been so numerous (3-4 per week) that we aren&amp;#39;t exactly sure what to do with them. While we enjoy research and projects involving video games, we don&amp;#39;t want to the sub to be taken over by social science majors collecting data. So we&amp;#39;re asking the community: What should be done with regard to surveys?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Contest Mode&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contest Mode is a method of sorting that was introduced during the bestof2012 competition; it randomizes the comment order and hides the upvotes/downvotes. We have been discussing this and we want to know what the community thinks of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Spirit of &lt;a href=\"/r/truegaming\"&gt;/r/truegaming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/ickws/lets_talk_about_truegaming/\"&gt;docjesus wrote about the spirit of truegaming, and I want to make sure everyone remembers it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any concerns and questions will be addressed in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"My goodness we've grown quite a bit. 80,000 users already! With that in mind, it's time for another State of the Sub.\n\n### Automod\n\nAs you know, we brought on automoderator to remove posts/comments less than 150 characters in length. The result of this experiment has been positive, and because of this we are going to continue using automoderator. However, automoderator will no longer send messages to users after the posts are removed. Be sure to check the length of posts when you submit them (and don't add fluff to make your post longer; I've seen it done and remove the posts on sight).\n\n### New moderators\n\nGive a warm welcome to Fitzsimmons and jmarquiso, our newest moderators. As we grow larger, the burden of moderating grows; since this isn't a very moderator-friendly sub (reading every comment and every post takes a toll on you), new moderators will end up being needed. We are not accepting applications right now for moderators, but when we are we already have a few people in mind.\n\n### Good post etiquette\n\nIt's come to the attention of the moderators that there are a lot of bad examples of posts. Here are some tips to follow when making a post:\n\n* Have a good title. \"More customization/personal games\" is a bad title, just because it's vague (it gets an idea across, but the idea is very vague); \"What elements make for a more solid, wholesome horror experience? Are jump-scares and gore getting boring?\" is a good title: it's specific and interesting.\n\n* Be specific and elaborate often. A rule in English writing is to avoid the passive verb \"to be\"; opt instead for more active verbs. \"X is a good game\" makes for a poor comment. \"X shows how it's possible to give the player unlimited power while also creating challenges to surpass\" is specific, and you can build off of it with more examples from the game.\n\n* Be polite, and don't get into flame wars.

It&amp;#39;s currently my most played game after SC2.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Yes, I am a relative newbie to the game. I&amp;#39;ve only finished the game once and haven&amp;#39;t gotten very far yet with an NG+ playthrough. In most singleplayer games that would qualify you as at least somewhat knowledgeable, but I realize DS is a bit of a different beast in that regard.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I realize this game is/has been reddit&amp;#39;s wet dream concerning skill-based game design in the recent past. I also realize I risk pissing off a large contingent of avid fans. However, I notice a serious lack of discussion about the game that doesn&amp;#39;t justify any and all flaws as &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s just hardcore like that. L2P.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I want to do in this thread is have that discussion: take an objective look at the game&amp;#39;s pros and cons and try to be honest about what is unforgiving game design and what is sloppy and/or broken. In order to further the state of the gaming industry, it would be helpful to pinpoint exactly what can be learned from DS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To start things off myself:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invasions&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a PvE player like myself, they&amp;#39;re just stupid. You&amp;#39;re merrily on your way, fighting some new kind of monster, barely hanging on and xXxR4ng3rKn1ght420xXx steps up and backstabs you, and you are now potentially out of X humanity and (in my most recent case) ~40.000 souls. Focus on the invader and the regular monsters will kill you. As any PvP player will tell you, the soul level limit does very little to keep fights balanced when players can make dedicated PvP characters and transfer high-level gear to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can only get invaded when you are in human form. Same with summoning allies or NPCs. Risk vs reward type design, it makes sense, and this is usually how players justify this design. \nI would agree if it were not for this one thing: &lt;em&gt;You can&amp;#39;t avoid being human quite regularly.&lt;/em&gt; There is no way to kindle bonfires without that. \nWhen do you kindle bonfires? &lt;em&gt;When you&amp;#39;ve just arrived in an area and are having a hard time, almost by definition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The design choice to link activating/upgrading a save point and opening yourself up to PvP is a nonsensical one, IMO. It makes you vulnerable to other players with the sole intention of killing you at exactly the time when you are weakest. Gameplay-wise, the two have nothing to do with eachother. The only way to avoid it is go through the game with only 5 Estus flasks. For a game that prides itself on being skillbased, brutal and honest, being randomly assassinated by overleveled players is a bad fit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weapon hits/collisions&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is it that my uchi gets stuck on a wall when I slash more or less parallel to it, yet that Titanite Demon over there swings a huge axe through two solid walls and hits me? Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, it&amp;#39;s not a huge issue or anything, but there are instances in the game where a fight is uncharacteristically hard because you are hindered by your surroundings while your opponents are not. This is pretty much the sole reason I stopped using greatswords - it is simply too common to get into areas where you can&amp;#39;t even swing them properly. Getting hit by a dagger through a massive column is not good game design no matter how you spin it, and it seems more like an oversight or laziness on the developer&amp;#39;s part than anything that can be justified as a conscious design choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are other instances where the weapon hit detection is a bit dodgy. Getting hit by the slow-moving blunt rear-end of a spear, for example, and taking full stab damage. Or enemies adjusting their flight path or facing in mid-air to compensate for your movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this were the first game in the series I would be understanding of these errors. However, it isn&amp;#39;t. I never played Demon&amp;#39;s Souls, but I&amp;#39;m assuming it was the same in that game? If this is a conscious decision, what could possibly justify it? I am at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blighttown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This area isn&amp;#39;t actually all that difficult combat wise. It&amp;#39;s just bloody annoying. The level design has you walking across all kinds of rickety structures, often with strange geometry sticking out or holes in the surfaces. I think the moving bridge takes the cake: standing still at certain spots while it&amp;#39;s moving will slide you off the side due to weird bounding boxes. Now, when you put enemies in an area like this that are capable of bumping you into a chasm even if you block their attack, you&amp;#39;re just messing with players. You&amp;#39;re more or less forcing a bunch of random deaths caused by unpredictable/unavoidable knockbacks (depending on player build and loadout. For a shield+sword player, or heavy armor player this is hell. Dodge-based characters will have a hard time as well, but at least it&amp;#39;s in their own hands whether they dodge off a bridge or not.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the fact that you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; get poisoned going through the swamp no matter how high your poison resistance is and there is no merchant in the area. In order to get through Quelaag, I had to get back out of the Swamp, back up to Undead Burg, buy a ton of moss clumps and get back in. Complete time sink for very little (if any) gain in gameplay quality.\nAlso, toxic blowdarts with laser guidance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what are your thoughts? Feel free to attack any of my points above as long as your main argument is not &amp;quot;learn to play&amp;quot;. If I was just bothered by the game being difficult I would not be going through a second playthrough now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: If you had to explain some of Dark Soul&amp;#39;s oddities and were forbidden to use &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s unforgiving&amp;quot; as an argument, what would you say?

You are required to go back to Sen&amp;#39;s, redirect the boulder machine, then talk to Siegmeyer again and he will possibly be fixed. I&amp;#39;ve heard mixed reports about whether this actually works. Already beat O&amp;amp;S? Byebye Siegmeyer storyline.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Being able to kill Gwynevere in Anor Londo without triggering the results, simply by using a ranged weapon outside of her room.

So, you&amp;#39;re mostly going to be using the zoomed-in mode. Why, then, do you need to explicitly exit this zoom mode before you can swap your weapon to a different one? Dodge doesn&amp;#39;t work, running doesn&amp;#39;t work, estus doesn&amp;#39;t work, nothing works. Only LB1 and RB1. See an enemy coming up to attack and want to get your shield out and block? LB1, d-pad away from bow, LB1. A bit weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same thing for the in-game menu. It&amp;#39;s not particularly handy to block off your estus, run and roll buttons as long as you have the UI open. I like how it doesn&amp;#39;t pause the game, but then you should also execute the concept fully and be able to completely control your character with the menu open. This half-way approach isn&amp;#39;t very good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Now, to get some things out of the way immediately: \n\n- Yes, it's hard, it's unforgiving and I love it. It's currently my most played game after SC2.\n- Yes, I am a relative newbie to the game. I've only finished the game once and haven't gotten very far yet with an NG+ playthrough. In most singleplayer games that would qualify you as at least somewhat knowledgeable, but I realize DS is a bit of a different beast in that regard.\n- I realize this game is/has been reddit's wet dream concerning skill-based game design in the recent past. I also realize I risk pissing off a large contingent of avid fans. However, I notice a serious lack of discussion about the game that doesn't justify any and all flaws as \"it's just hardcore like that. L2P.\"\n\nWhat I want to do in this thread is have that discussion: take an objective look at the game's pros and cons and try to be honest about what is unforgiving game design and what is sloppy and/or broken. In order to further the state of the gaming industry, it would be helpful to pinpoint exactly what can be learned from DS.\n\n---\n\nTo start things off myself:\n\n**Invasions**:\n\nFor a PvE player like myself, they're just stupid. You're merrily on your way, fighting some new kind of monster, barely hanging on and xXxR4ng3rKn1ght420xXx steps up and backstabs you, and you are now potentially out of X humanity and (in my most recent case) ~40.000 souls. Focus on the invader and the regular monsters will kill you. As any PvP player will tell you, the soul level limit does very little to keep fights balanced when players can make dedicated PvP characters and transfer high-level gear to them.\n\nOf course, you can only get invaded when you are in human form.

This [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_prime#Development) implies that Retro made their engine in-house.

I always thought, is it really that expensive? Because in my opinion it really is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this is not a console wars thread, because I get it that they have good games that are exclusives to them, and it is quite easier and more comfortable to play games on consoles. So yeah they do have some merit to them. \nI also dont want to talk about PCs being superior to consoles. I just want to discuss the notion that gaming PCs are quite expensive, and you have to keep updating hw every two years and blah blah blah. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, you don’t HAVE to update every two years. I mean, you can, but you don’t necessarily have to. Its not like when new generation of gfx card comes, people have to go like “Fuck now I have to upgrade. AGAIN”. Its more like “Wow. Now I can upgrade if I want to”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it has been said countless times in the console wars thread, that decent PC for games can be built in like $400-500 [which you really can actually, so it is true]. But wait a minute. We know that practically everyone owns a PC these days. Maybe not all, but a large number of console gamers have a PC in their house. Now, you have a decent PC, right? But not a gaming PC. You know what? Slap a $200 gfx card on it, and its a decent gaming PC. For $200 you can easily get a 7850 [and two free games with it] or a 650Ti Boost, which are quite decent mid level gfx card. This is exactly what I did, 3 years back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whats more? The games on PC are relatively cheaper even at launch [most games cost $50 on PC as opposed to $60 on consoles]. There are also Steam sales where you can buy tonnes of games for as cheap as sand. You can build a decent games library really cheap. So really, playing on PC is much cheaper than playing on a console, in a long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, you wanna play on consoles? Please do so. But don’t say gaming PC, or playing games on PC is expensive than consoles, because it really is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: If you are on XBox, you have to pay for the online, which is FREE for PC. More money saved.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Whenever I see a thread about those console wars, and people saying \"PC gaming is expensive\" I always thought, is it really that expensive? Because in my opinion it really is not.\n\nNow this is not a console wars thread, because I get it that they have good games that are exclusives to them, and it is quite easier and more comfortable to play games on consoles. So yeah they do have some merit to them. \nI also dont want to talk about PCs being superior to consoles. I just want to discuss the notion that gaming PCs are quite expensive, and you have to keep updating hw every two years and blah blah blah. \n\nFirst of all, you don’t HAVE to update every two years. I mean, you can, but you don’t necessarily have to. Its not like when new generation of gfx card comes, people have to go like “Fuck now I have to upgrade. AGAIN”. Its more like “Wow. Now I can upgrade if I want to”.\n\nSecondly, it has been said countless times in the console wars thread, that decent PC for games can be built in like $400-500 [which you really can actually, so it is true]. But wait a minute. We know that practically everyone owns a PC these days. Maybe not all, but a large number of console gamers have a PC in their house. Now, you have a decent PC, right? But not a gaming PC. You know what? Slap a $200 gfx card on it, and its a decent gaming PC. For $200 you can easily get a 7850 [and two free games with it] or a 650Ti Boost, which are quite decent mid level gfx card. This is exactly what I did, 3 years back. \n\nWhats more? The games on PC are relatively cheaper even at launch [most games cost $50 on PC as opposed to $60 on consoles]. There are also Steam sales where you can buy tonnes of games for as cheap as sand. You can build a decent games library really cheap. So really, playing on PC is much cheaper than playing on a console, in a long run.\n\nNow, you wanna play on consoles? Please do so. But don’t say gaming PC, or playing games on PC is expensive than consoles, because it really is not.\n\nEDIT: If you are on XBox, you have to pay for the online, which is FREE for PC.

Today, I&amp;#39;m going to explain a little bit more about how this group movement actually works - and also introduce a new monster to the pack: The Skeleton Archer, with its Ranged Attacks. Combine Archers and Skeletons together and you have quite a challenging group of foes to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ Group Chasing Behaviours in Detail ]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s break this group chasing behaviour down:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 . &lt;strong&gt;Detection Phase&lt;/strong&gt;. For each frame (more specifically each iteration of the Behaviour Tree), the monster maintains 2 lists: threats (you), and friendlies (other skeletons) - based on line of sight. Entities that cannot be seen are not included in this list. The lists are cleared at the beginning of each iteration. In addition to these, breadcrumbs dropped by both threats and friendlies are also recorded. In future versions, things like visible furniture, entrances and exit doors, walls etc... will also be added. By this point, the monster now has a reasonable view of the world on this exact frame, and we use this information to help the AI determine what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 . &lt;strong&gt;Intention Phase&lt;/strong&gt;. This is where the Behaviour Tree comes in handy - to aid in the decision making process. We&amp;#39;ll not cover the specifics of the Behaviour Tree implementation here - the details are too numerous and will best fit in a future post. For an overview of Behaviour Trees, AIGameDev covers this particularly well: &lt;a href=\"http://aigamedev.com/open/article/bt-overview/\"&gt;http://aigamedev.com/open/article/bt-overview/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, conceptually speaking, our tree models a list of ordered priorities: A. Deal with threats, B. Follow alerted friendlies, C. Patrol. The first one we&amp;#39;ve already covered in Part 1: monsters chase after players in their line of sight, then breadcrumbs (smell trail), then to the target&amp;#39;s last recorded location. If these actions fail - the next branch (priority) of the tree is parsed and the monster has a look at what the friendlies are up to. If his friends are alerted, this state is passed on and the monster becomes alerted also. He then proceeds to follow the alerted friend in the same way as in priority A (again line of sight, breadcrumbs, and last recorded location). If this fails also (there are no &lt;strong&gt;alerted&lt;/strong&gt; friends visible), then we fall back to patrol (with best guess).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priority B is particularly important - it allows the monsters to follow each other in a chain/queue-like fashion. As long as the leader of the pack is alerted and can see the enemy, this state and behaviour is propagated to other mobs down in the chain. There&amp;#39;s some bugs and caveats to this method, one of them is that it&amp;#39;s easy for the monsters to chase each other in a loop (or pairs), so there&amp;#39;s some failsafe hackery code to stop this from happening. This is WIP, we plan on cleaning up this behaviour during production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 . &lt;strong&gt;Movement Phase&lt;/strong&gt;. Simply apply the intentions above to actual movement (modify velocities, update positions, repel from walls, separate from nearby entities etc..)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ Skeleton Archers and Ranged Attacks in Detail ]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where the Behaviour Trees really shine. Because we&amp;#39;ve already defined a lot of the basic maneuvers described in Part 1, 2 &amp;amp; 3 as &lt;strong&gt;behaviour nodes&lt;/strong&gt; we can now mix and match them to create new behaviours in our tree. A good example, is the Skeleton Archer. In our tree, there is a conditional node that switches between Chasing Behaviours (from Part 1) and Retreating Behaviours (Part 2). The condition is a whether the distance from the monster to the player is above or below 2 thresholds. To illustrate, we might have an Archer chase the player if it is 100 units away, but flee from the player if it is less than 50. The gap between the 50 and 100 threshold is to ensure we don&amp;#39;t rubber band between the two states too quickly, so if the distance is 75 units, we remain in the current state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the resulting behaviour is that the Archer maintains a nice position away from you: never to engage in melee combat but always close enough to use his bow and arrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ Conclusion ]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from the new Archer behaviours, there&amp;#39;s no special code to formulate groups here. It just so happens that a combination of melee type Skeletons (who are extremely aggressive and will chase you down as much as possible) and ranged Archers (who are cautious and will try to maintain a certain distance from you) results in quite effective emergent behaviour - it almost looks like they are working together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ More Ideas for Group AI ]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The above shows very basic, fundamental rules for group interaction. It&amp;#39;s a work in progress - but we plan on bringing more complex manoeuvres in regards to group tactics. Depending on the monster type, critters will be able to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Monsters won&amp;#39;t attack if they are alone, and will flee instead. Some intelligent ones will flee towards a known group of other monsters. This results in luring, pulling the character towards a more dangerous area and then attacking again.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wounded skeletons prefer to escape while their friends are locked in battle - to go and find corpses, heal, and return to the fray later.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leaders - if a Skeleton King is in the area, his minions will tend to follow and do what he does.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flanking - if the player is currently engaged in battle, other monsters will attempt to flank you from either side or behind.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ A plea for help for the next two days ]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As some of you may already know - my game TinyKeep is on Kickstarter and there are currently only 2 days left of funding to go!
